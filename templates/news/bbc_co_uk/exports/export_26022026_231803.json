Roman staircases are rarely found intact, so this was a very special discovery.\n\nThe finds were buried underneath the LVR Jewish Museum in the Archaeological Quarter of the city.\n\nThe staircase once led from a large palace, called the praetorium (the residence of a Roman commanding officer or governor).\n\nThe steps were needed because the land slopes down towards the River Rhine.\n\nLater Roman building work covered part of the stairs, which actually helped to protect them for centuries.\n\nThe uncovered site also revealed the massive foundations to what would have been a 4th century Roman basilica, or church.",

    "title": "three UK businesses that made millions from small beginnings",
    "content": "When you think about how big businesses get started, what do you imagine?\n\nA high-powered boardroom, with a Lord Sugar figure presiding over affairs? Tycoons sat in a loft conversion, deciding whether they’re in or out with their investments?\n\nHow about in a student house, spare bedroom or on the kitchen table?\n\nSome of the UK’s most recent business success stories began in modest surroundings before going on to be national and international successes.\n\nBBC Bitesize explores some of the bedroom businesses that went big.\n\nClassic Football Shirts\n\nIt began in a student house in Fallowfield, Manchester and led to a business worth tens of millions of pounds, that received investment from a Hollywood star and collaborations with David Beckham and Ian Wright.\n\nClassic Football Shirts began 20 years ago in 2006 with a student night out. Business management student Doug Bierton decided to go to a fancy dress party as Paul Gascoigne – and found a 1990 England shirt in a charity shop.\n\nAfter snapping it up for £5, shortly after the party he listed the item on eBay and sold it for £50 – and an idea was born.\n\nDoug teamed up with course-mate Matt Dale, a football and kit enthusiast – and after setting up a website, devoted their time to finding retro shirts for low prices, and selling them on for profit.\n\nIt began as a hobby, but quickly escalated into a business. Shirts were snapped up, private collections purchased – and the pair, who also got Doug’s brother Gary involved, soon found themselves overwhelmed by the volume of shirts they’d acquired.\n\nThey moved to a warehouse near Manchester City’s stadium in 2011, and traded up to an even bigger site in 2020. After a series of pop-ups, their first permanent store opened in Manchester in 2018 and they now have retail sites in London, New York and Los Angeles as well.\n\nThe team also caught some of the Hollywood vibes that Wrexham have enjoyed in recent years. Co-owner Rob Mac visited the Manchester store and was so impressed, he later invested in the business alongside others including USA’s two-time Women’s World Cup winner Alex Morgan.\n\nFollowing investment, the business is said to be worth tens of millions of pounds now – not bad for starting with a fiver on a 1990 Umbro classic.\n\nTrunki\n\nPitching for investment can be a frightening prospect at the best of times. Now imagine doing it on tv and having one of your potential investors break your product.\n\nIt’s the stuff of nightmares and it happened to Rob Law on Dragon’s Den as he sought investment in his range of Trunki children’s suitcases.\n\nA product design student, Rob took part in a luggage design competition at university. He was in a toy shop and was taken by all the ride-along toys available and wondered if he could combine in with a suitcase – to prevent children from being bored in an airport, dragging their bags behind them.\n\nHe set up a business in his flat and created Trunki, a ride-along suitcase, but struggled to find a place for it initially. Retailers couldn’t see where the idea fit – was it a toy or luggage – so he turned to Dragon’s Den for investment.\n\nIt couldn’t have gone much worse. One of the Dragons broke the suitcase strap and he left without a penny, but gained something much, much more valuable – public interest.\n\nViewers loved the idea. Kids liked the idea of riding around the airport and parents liked the idea of removing an element of stress from their holidays. Trunki started being stocked by major retailers across the country and went international – selling millions of cases in more than 100 countries worldwide.\n\nRob sold the business in 2023 for £12 million – not bad considering the Dragons called his suitcase idea worthless 17 years earlier.\n\nJo Malone\n\nShe’s responsible for creating one of the world’s most recognisable perfume brands – but Jo Malone’s beauty empire began on a kitchen table.\n\nAs a teenager, she started an at-home skincare clinic and would gift her clients a homemade body lotion or bath oil. When one customer bought 100 bottles, she thought she might have landed on a winning business strategy, but it’s fair to say it wasn’t on the cards for her throughout her childhood.",

    "title": "The 'food noise' phenomenon – and expert tips for managing it",
    "content": "\"Essentially, it refers to persistent, intrusive or repetitive thoughts about food,\" says psychologist and disordered eating specialist Dr Charlotte Ord, external.\n\nThat could be obsessing over what to eat next, feeling preoccupied by food or dieting, avoiding certain foods or developing rigid eating habits or rules.\n\n\"For me, it is intrinsically linked to exposure to diet culture messaging and the practice of dieting itself,\" says Ord.\n\n\"We tend to become preoccupied with food when we experience food restriction through dieting. Our brains are wired to perceive this as famine – which is a potential threat. This drives our focus to renourishment, even when food isn't scarce.\"\n\nMost of us mull over what to have for dinner and look forward to a delicious meal.\n\n\"Food noise, on the other hand, is persistent and intrusive,\" says Ord. \"It shows up when you aren't hungry – sometimes even when you're full – and is often very emotionally charged.\n\n\"It can be accompanied by guilt, obsessions or preoccupation. It interferes with quality of life in a way that normal, healthy thoughts about food do not.\"\n\n\"Someone who's struggling with food noise will usually find it very distracting and have trouble concentrating at work or being present with loved ones,\" says Ord.\n\nThey might overthink their food choices too, asking themselves questions like, 'Shall I have this? Will I feel bad about it? Is it healthy? Shall I have another one?'.\n\n\"They will often feel a lot of guilt, shame and anxiety around their food choices and this is often accompanied by disordered eating behaviours and difficult thoughts around their shape and weight.\n\n\"Sometimes, it features alongside excessive exercise or is exacerbated by heavy involvement in fitness environments that often encourage rigid ways of eating and training.\"\n\nDr Jack Mosley, GP and author of Food Noise, explains: \"You've got hunger-induced eating – when you haven't eaten for three or four hours and you want that next meal. And you've got reward-based eating – that's where you get feelings of pleasure from the thought or act of eating.\n\n\"The weight loss drugs seem to work for both of these categories. They reduce your appetite – in your brain and in your gut – but they also seem to curb reward-driven eating.\n\n\"Some of the hormones involved in rewards such as dopamine are dialed down, meaning people experience less anticipation and excitement from eating.\n\n\"As an example, think of being in a petrol station and seeing a packet of your favourite sweets and feeling tempted to buy it, or smelling fast food and feeling the urge to go and get some for yourself.\n\n\"These sensations are reduced when you're on the medication – and if you do have any, you're more satisfied with a smaller amount.\"\n\nMosley likens weight-loss injections to noise-cancelling headphones – you put them on and can go about your day without being constantly distracted by food noise.\n\n\"But ultimately, when you take them off, that noise returns with a vengeance.\n\n\"The research shows that when people come off these new weight loss medications, they regain two thirds of the weight, external they lost within the first year. And by 20 months they have normally regained all of it.\"\n\nThat's why, if you're on weight loss medication, Mosley says it's crucial to use that time and headspace to make sustainable, long-term changes to your lifestyle, ingraining healthy eating habits that you can stick to without medication.\n\n1. Get organised\n\n\"Once a week, get all your food in and plan your week's meals. So, when you're stressed, you don't revert to the default setting you previously had,\" says Mosley.\n\nOrd adds, \"Eat regular, consistent meals every few hours to keep hormone levels stable. Ensure this includes a balance of carbohydrates, protein and fats to support appetite regulation. Do not skip meals!\n\n\"Diets such as the Mediterranean-style diet, which include plenty of protein, healthy fats, fibre and complex carbs, will help.\"\n\n2. Don't rely on willpower\n\n\"Willpower is somewhat overrated,\" says Mosley. \"When we see food, we want it. So clear out your cupboards of 'addictive' foods. Replace them with whole foods.\"\n\nThat said, if you do occasionally have something that's high in calories, like a chocolate bar, Mosley urges you to be kind to yourself. It doesn't mean you've failed.\n\nThere's help and support available.\n\n\"Experiencing food noise doesn't mean there's something fundamentally wrong with you, nor does it have to last forever,\" says Ord.\n\n\"It's a sign your brain is doing exactly what it's designed to do – keep you safe. When your brain thinks there's a chance of famine or only knows how to soothe distress by regulating itself with food, it will drive you to focus on it.\"\n\nHealing from food noise means rebuilding your relationship with food, understanding your emotional needs and learning to nourish yourself in ways that go beyond eating, says Ord – that will quiet the food noise and let you put food back in its rightful place.\n\nOriginally published July 2025.

    "content": "Defending champions India kept their T20 World Cup semi-final hopes alive and eliminated opponents Zimbabwe with a 72-run victory in Chennai.\n\nHaving previously gone unbeaten in the group stage, Zimbabwe leaked more than 250 runs for the second consecutive match in the Super 8s as India piled on 256-4.\n\nIt is the second highest total in T20 World Cup history behind Sri Lanka's 260-6 against Kenya in the inaugural event in 2007.\n\nOpener Abhishek Sharma top-scored with 55 off 30 balls, including four fours and four sixes, all-rounder Hardik Pandya completed a 23-ball half-century with a six off the final delivery of the innings, and Tilak Varma flashed an unbeaten 44 from 16.\n\nChasing 257, Zimbabwe opener Brian Bennett showcased his talent, registering his third unbeaten half-century of the tournament with 97 from 59 balls.\n\nThe 22-year-old, whose fifty came off 34 balls, struck eight fours and six sixes but lacked support, with Sikandar Raza's 31 (21) the next highest score.\n\nNow level on two points with West Indies, India know victory over the two-time champions in Kolkata on Sunday will secure their spot in the last four.\n\nSouth Africa, who beat West Indies by nine wickets to maintain their 100% record at this tournament, join England in qualifying for the semi-finals with a game to spare.\n\nIndia had enjoyed a relatively comfortable passage through the initial group stage, winning all four of their matches and twice passing 190 with the bat, but had their wings clipped by South Africa in their Super 8 opener.\n\nChasing 187, they were bowled out for 111 - a result which left them in near must-win territory as they headed to Chennai.\n\nZimbabwe captain Raza, whose side were in a similar position, said at the toss it would \"come down to a battle of nerves\". India showed none as they bludgeoned their highest total at a T20 World Cup and passed 250 in a men's T20 international for the fifth time.\n\nSharma, who came into the match under pressure having registered three ducks in his past four innings, set the tone with a 26-ball half-century.\n\nInitially content to play second fiddle to Sanju Samson, who struck the second ball of the match for six and made a quickfire 24 from 15 deliveries, he led India to 80-1 at the end of the powerplay, striking three fours and three sixes.\n\nHis second-wicket partnership with Ishan Kishan (38) was worth 72 runs and although Kishan could not capitalise on Tashinga Musekiwa dropping him on 26, Suryakumar Yadav punished Zimbabwe's sloppy fielding. Dropped on eight by Blessing Muzarabani, the India skipper thrashed 33 from 13 deliveries.\n\nIt was Zimbabwe's fifth drop from 15 attempts in the Super 8s. In the group stage, during which they were unbeaten, they had a catching efficiency of 95.2% and dropped just one.\n\nThough Suryakumar was striking above 250, his departure flicked a switch for India, with Hardik and Varma piling on 84 runs in the final 5.1 overs, including seven sixes. Hardik accelerated from 12 from eight balls to 50 not out from 23, while Varma found the boundary seven times in 16 deliveries.\n\nOn a bruising day, Zimbabwe's four pace bowlers leaked 3-197 from 14 overs.",

    "title": "Spain to check Gibraltar arrivals under post-Brexit border deal",
    "content": "The UK is to allow Spanish border guards to check the passports of travellers to Gibraltar, under a deal with the EU to create an open land border with Spain.\n\nThe extra Spanish checks, to be carried out at the Rock's airport and port, have been confirmed in a 1,000-page draft treaty published on Thursday, external.\n\nThe agreement is designed to bring certainty to the British overseas territory nearly a decade after the Brexit vote threw its status into doubt.\n\nIt is due to come into force in April, when stricter controls at the border of the passport-free Schengen zone are due to come fully into force.\n\nUnder the deal, Gibraltar will not officially join the zone, made up of 29 mainly EU countries including Spain.\n\nInstead, Spanish authorities will carry out a \"second line\" of Schengen border controls, following immigration checks conducted by Gibraltar officials.\n\nSpanish guards will have powers to arrest, search and interview travellers \"where it is justified in the course of border control,\" according to the treaty.\n\nThe Foreign Office said British passport holders will have to provide fingerprints to Spanish border officials when they arrive at Gibraltar airport under the deal.\n\nThe EU's Entry Exit System, a digital border control system which involves registering fingerprints and a photo as well as a passport check, will apply to non-EU nationals entering the territory.\n\nThe system should eventually allow for the removal of 'La Verja', the 1.2km (0.7 mile) chain link fence along Gibraltar's land border with Spain, which is crossed every day by around half of the Rock's workforce.\n\nIt would mean the disappearance of \"the last wall in continental Europe,\" said Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares in a video clip welcoming the deal, external.\n\nThe UK government is likening the new system to that in operation at London's St Pancras station, where Eurostar passengers are checked by both British and French border officials.\n\nBritish nationals make up a huge share of visitors travelling to Gibraltar for tourism, representing 86.5% of all departures from its airport in 2024, according to the territory's most recent tourism survey, external.\n\nSince Brexit, Spain has allowed Gibraltar residents to cross the border without having their passports stamped, but there have been periodic complaints from Gibraltar about Spanish police tightening checks.\n\nFrom April, Spain had been due to apply the EU's new automated border system, including biometric checks, at the border with Gibraltar, which the UK says would \"devastate\" Gibraltar's economy.\n\nFabian Picardo, the territory's chief minister, has welcomed the agreement, adding it delivers \"the certainty our people and businesses need\".\n\nGibraltar's government says it is hoping to provisionally apply the deal from 10 April, the date when the EU's new border system is scheduled to become fully operational after several previous setbacks.\n\nThe deal will see the territory join the EU's customs union, and align its import taxes to those applied by Spain.\n\nAlthough Gibraltar will keep its zero-VAT regime, it will charge a new \"transaction tax\" on the customs value of goods imported into or made in the territory for sale there, which will start at 15% and rise to 17% by 2028.\n\nPicardo told BBC Radio 4's World At One it would mean some products in Gibraltar \"might become a little more expensive\" but said the agreement overall would increase traffic to the territory's shops.",
