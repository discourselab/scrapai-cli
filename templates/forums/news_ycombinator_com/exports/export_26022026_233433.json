          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">As far as I can tell, all of these attacks require the attacker to already be associated to a victim's network.  Most of these attacks seem similar to ones expected on shared wifi (airports, cafes) that have been known about for a while.  The novel attacks seem to exploit weaknesses in particular router implementations that didn't actually segregate traffic between guest and normal networks.<p>I'm curious if I missed something because that doesn't sound like it allows the worst kind of attacks, e.g. drive-by with no ability to associate to APs without cracking keys.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Hi and thanks so much for the valuable research!! I know it has been asked a lot here already, and probably some in-deep reading would help figure that out by myself. But I’ve noticed that you used Cisco 9130 APs, and noticed only part of the attack work on those. So wanted to ask whether you tested those with just IP based network separation, or also the VLAN-based one? Also, since you’ve mentioned the findings have been communicated to the vendors and the WiFi alliance alike, may I ask you to maybe share a CVE number here? I (as probably a lot of us here), use some of the hardware mentioned for personal goals/hobby in my home setup, and find it fun to keep that setup reasonably protected for the sake (fun) of it. Much appreciated!</div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">We don't have a CVE number. Whether devices/networks are affected also highly depends on the specific configuration of the device/network. This means that some might interpret some of the identified weaknesses as software flaws, but other weaknesses can also be seen as configuration issues. That's actually what makes some of our findings hard to 'fix': it's easy to say that someone else is responsible for properly ensuring client isolation :) Hence also hard to really assign CVE(s).<p>One of the main takeaway issues, in my view, is that it's just hard to correctly deploy client isolation in more complex networks. I think it <i>can</i> be done using modern hardware, but it's very tedious. We didn't test with VLAN separation, but using that can definitely help. Enterprise devices also require a high amount of expertise, meaning we might have missed some specialised settings.. So I'd recommend testing your Wi-Fi network, and then see which settings or routing configurations to change: <a href=\"https://github.com/vanhoefm/airsnitch\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/vanhoefm/airsnitch</a></p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt;Unlike previous Wi-Fi attacks, AirSnitch exploits core features in Layers 1 and 2 and the failure to bind and synchronize a client across these and higher layers, other nodes, and other network names such as SSIDs (Service Set Identifiers). This cross-layer identity desynchronization is the key driver of AirSnitch attacks.<p>&gt;The most powerful such attack is a full, bidirectional machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, meaning the attacker can view and modify data before it makes its way to the intended recipient. The attacker can be on the same SSID, a separate one, or even a separate network segment tied to the same AP. It works against small Wi-Fi networks in both homes and offices and large networks in enterprises.</p><p>----</p><p>I wardrove back in the early 2000s (¡WEP lol!).

In some respects, it resembles the 2007 PTW attack ... that completely and immediately broke WEP, leaving Wi-Fi users everywhere with no means to protect themselves against nearby adversaries. For now, client isolation is similarly defeated—almost completely and overnight—with no immediate remedy available.</p></div>"

I am curious about whether the type of EAP matters for reading the traffic.<p>Essentially everyone with the SSID on multiple access point MAC addresses can get pwned.</p><p>Neighhood hackers drove me to EAP TLS a few years ago, and I only have it on one frequency, so the attack will not work.</p><p>The mitigation is having only a single MAC for the AP that you can connect to.  The attack relies on bouncing between two. A guest and regular, or a 2.4 and 5, etc.</p><p>I need to research more to know if they can read all the packets if they pull it off on EAP TLS, with bounces between a 2.4 and 5 ghz.</p><p>It is a catastrophic situation unless you are using 20 year old state of the art rather that multi spectrum new hotness.</p><p>It might even get folks on a single SSID MAC if they do not notice the denial of service taking place.  I need to research the radius implications more.  TLS never sends credentials over the channel like the others.  It needs investigation to know if they get the full decryption key from EAP TLS during.   They were not using TLS because their tests covered Radius and the clients sending credentials.</p><p>It looks disastrous if the certificates of EAP TLS do not carry the day and they can devise the key.</p><p>That is my take.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">It's trivial to look up the switch port configuration of a consumer router once you put OpenWRT on it. The most common topology is the CPU has two RGMII/XGMII or similar links to an 8-port switch chip, five more ports of the switch are connected PHYs for external ports and configured for the LAN VLAN, and the last port is connected to a PHY for an external port and configured for the WAN VLAN. This does not result in any VLAN tags being emitted over the wire, but from the perspective of the switch silicon it's just one of many possible VLAN configurations. Changing which physical port is the WAN port is as simple as assigning a different switch port to that VLAN. If you <i>did</i> want VLAN tags emitted on a particular port, it's a single checkbox or single-character config file change.</div>"

Secondly the MAC randomization timeouts require reassignment.</p><p>The trouble with SAE per device passwords is that the commit makes it difficult to evaluate more than one password per pairing without knowing the identity of a device (the MAC) a-priori, which is why it's harder to find this deployed in production. It's possible for an AP to cycle through a few attempts but not many, whereas in WPA2 an AP could rotate through all the passwords without a commit. The standard needs to adapt.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c5A\">The article is hot garbage, here's the abstract from the paper (<a href=\"https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/airsnitch-demystifying-and-breaking-client-isolation-in-wi-fi-networks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/airsnitch-demystif...</a>):<p>To prevent malicious Wi-Fi clients from attacking other clients on the same network, vendors have introduced client isolation, a combination of mechanisms that block direct communication between clients. However, client isolation is not a standardized feature, making its security guarantees unclear. In this paper, we undertake a structured security analysis of Wi-Fi client isolation and uncover new classes of attacks that bypass this protection. We identify several root causes behind these weaknesses. First, Wi-Fi keys that protect broadcast frames are improperly managed and can be abused to bypass client isolation. Second, isolation is often only enforced at the MAC or IP layer, but not both. Third, weak synchronization of a client’s identity across the network stack allows one to bypass Wi-Fi client isolation at the network layer instead, enabling the interception of uplink and downlink traffic of other clients as well as internal backend devices. Every tested router and network was vulnerable to at least one attack. More broadly, the lack of standardization leads to inconsistent, ad hoc, and often incomplete implementations of isolation across vendors. Building on these insights, we design and evaluate end-toend attacks that enable full machine-in-the-middle capabilities in modern Wi-Fi networks. Although client isolation effectively mitigates legacy attacks like ARP spoofing, which has long been considered the only universal method for achieving machinein-the-middle positioning in local area networks, our attack introduces a general and practical alternative that restores this capability, even in the presence of client isolation.</p></div>"

The \"never use negative instructions\" wisdom comes from general prompting where mentioning the unwanted thing can increase its likelihood. AGENTS.md is a different context though, the model is reading persistent rules for a session, not doing a single completion where priming effects matter as much.<p>But you're right that \"better\" isn't \"reliable.\" In practice it went from \"constantly ignored\" to \"followed maybe 80% of the time.\" The remaining 20% is the model encountering situations where it decides the instruction doesn't apply to this specific case.</p><p>Honest answer is probably somewhere between \"they don't work\" and \"write them right and you're fine.\" They raise the floor but don't guarantee anything.

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; The central promise—that distributed digital fabrication would bring manufacturing back to America, that every city would have micro-factories, that 3D printing would decentralize production—simply didn’t materialize.<p>I never heard that. It didn’t seem like 3D-printing ever showed sings of displacing existing ways of manufacturing at scale, did it? Units per hour and dollars per unit was never its strength. It was always going to be small things (and if anything big grew out of it, those would naturally transition to the more efficient manufacturing at scale).</p><p>Vibe coding, on the other hand, is competing against hand coding, and for many use cases is considerably more efficient. It’s clearly replacing a lot of hand coding.</p><p>BTW, I think a lot of people were/are greatly overestimating the value of coding to business success. It’s fungible from a macro perspective, so isn’t a moat by itself. There’s certainly a cost, but hardly the only one if you’re trying to be the next big startup (for that, the high cost of coding was useful — something to deter potential competitors; you’ll have to make up the difference in some other way now).</p><p>Also, software is something that already scaled really well in the way businesses need it to — code written once, whether by human or LLM, can be executed billions of times for almost nothing. Companies will be happy to have a way to press down the budget of a cost center, but the delta won’t make or break that many businesses.</p><p>As always, the people selling pick-axes during the gold rush will probably do the best.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; The higher paid engineers i've worked with are always worth their salary/hourly rate because of the way they approach problems and the solutions they come up with.<p>I'm honestly just happy at the moment, because our two junior admins/platform engineers have made some really good points to me in preparation for their annual reviews.</p><p>One now completed his own bigger terraform project, with the great praise of \"That looks super easy to maintain and use\" from the other more experienced engineers. He figured: \"It's weird, you actually end up thinking and poking at a problem for a week or two, and then it actually folds into a very small amount of code. And sure, Copilot helped a bit with some boilerplate, but that was only after figuring out how to structure and hold it\".</p><p>The other is working on getting a grip on running the big temperamental beast called PostgreSQL. She was recently a bit frustrated. \"How can it be so hard to configure a simple number! It's so easy to set it in ansible and roll it out, but to find the right value, you gotta search the entire universe from top to bottom and then the answer is &lt;maybe&gt;. AAaah I gotta yell at a team\". She's on a good way to become a great DBA.</p><p>&gt; Agents are great at building out features, i'm not so sure about complex software that grows over time. Unless you know the right questions to ask, the agent misses alot. 80/20 doesn't work for systems that need 100% reliability.</p><p>Or if it's very structured and testable. For example, we're seeing great value in rebuilding a Grafana instance from manually managed to scripted dashboards. After a bit of scaffolding, some style instructions and a few example systems, you can just chuck it a description and a few queries, it just goes to successful work and just needs a little tweaking afterwards.</p><p>Similar, we're now converting a few remnants of our old config management to the new one using AI agents. Setup a good test suite first, then throw old code and examples of how the new config management does it into the context and modern models do that well. At that point, just rebuilding the system once is better than year-long deprecation plans with undecided stakeholders as mobile as a pet ferret that doesn't want to.</p><p>It's really not the code holding the platform together, it's the team and the experiences and behaviors of people.</p></div>"

I’m finding Opus 4.6 is only really capable of solving a problem when the prompt explains the fix in such concrete detail that coding is incredibly straightforward. For example, if the prompt has enough detail that any decent human programmer would read it and end up writing basically the same code then Claude can probably manage it too.<p>While I haven’t used other models like Codex and Gemini all that much recently, Anthropic’s is one of the top-tier models, and so I believe the others are probably the same in this way.</p><p>A junior’s mind will not rot because the prompt basically has to contain detailed pseudocode in order to get anywhere.</p></div>"

Most of my time now is spent reviewing code instead of writing code, and that makes me a huge bottleneck. So the best way to optimize is to make the code more readable and having good automated checks to reduce the amount of work I need to do, like static types, no nulls, compilation, automated tests, secondary agent reviews, etc.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; Then it was a lot of “self replicating printers” for quite a while, which never has been a real thing.<p>3D-printed 3D printers got quite far; the reason why this topic got out of perception by people who are not 3D printing nerds is rather that for mass production of 3D printers there exist much better processes.</p><p>What was realized was that up to a certain amount of parts, 3D printing these parts on a 3D printer works really well. You can find a lot of designs of such 3D printers on the internet.</p><p>Concerning the progress here, also observe that over the last years, home 3D printers got a lot better with respect to handling \"engineering materials\". These materials are very useful if you want to (partly) 3D-print a 3D printer, but this development is often not associated with \"3D-printing 3D printers\". :-)</p><p>Then you get to parts which <i>can</i> be printed on a 3D printer, but these parts will not be of the same quality as parts that can easily be bought, such as belts etc. The Mulbot is a design that takes this approach very far:</p><p>&gt; <a href=\"https://github.com/3dprintingworld/Mulbot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/3dprintingworld/Mulbot</a></p><p>&gt; <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/model/5995-mulbot-the-mostly-printed-3d-printer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.printables.com/model/5995-mulbot-the-mostly-prin...</a></p><p>And then you get to parts that are nearly impossible to print on a 3D printer ...</p><p>So, after there was a consensus where the boundaries lie how much a 3D printer can sensibly be 3D-printed, people started looking at <i>other</i> manufacturing techniques that exist for producing parts of 3D printers, and started considering</p><p>1. could and how far could a machine for this process be 3D-printed (or produced on a 3D-printed machine)?</p><p>2. could we bring such a machine to home manufacturing, too (so that people can easily build such a machine at home)?</p><p>Machines that were considered for this were, for example, CNC mill (3, 4 and 5 axis), CNC lathe, pick and place machines (for producing PCBs), ...</p><p>There <i>do</i> exist partial implementations of such machines, just to give some examples:</p><p>- lots of designs of CNC mills that use 3D-printed parts. I won't give a list here, but just want to mention that the \"Voron Cascade\" project wants to do for home 3 axis CNC milling what the Voron did for 3D printing. Rumors on the internet say that the Voron Cascade is well on the way, but had quite a lot of delays with respect to announced release dates.</p><p>- an attempt to build a pick and place machine: <a href=\"https://hackaday.io/project/169354-3d-printed-pick-and-place-machine\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hackaday.io/project/169354-3d-printed-pick-and-place...</a></p><p>Thus: I hope I could give evidence that in the last years there still were a lot of developments towards the far goal of \"self-replicating 3D printers\", but these developments were rather silent, impressive developments instead of loud, obtrusive marketing stunts.</p></div>"

Previously, you'd spend <i>hours</i> on calibrating and leveling nonsense. Latest models don't have this problem. Open the app on your phone, (doom)scroll until you find something, and just hit print from your phone. You can make it more complicated as desired, but it's not necessary to get something out of your printer.<p>Which apes vibecoding.

Take a look at Space-X's Raptor engine. A rocket engine is mostly one piece of complicated metal with a lot of internal voids. That's something 3D printers are good at. Once 3D printing was able to print stainless steel and titanium, it could be used for hard jobs like that.

Tasks previously done laboriously by hand in hundreds of weavers’ cottages were brought together in a single cotton mill, and the factory was born. The second industrial revolution came in the early 20th century, when Henry Ford mastered the moving assembly line and ushered in the age of mass production. The first two industrial revolutions made people richer and more urban. Now a third revolution is under way. Manufacturing is going digital. As this week’s special report argues, this could change not just business, but much else besides.</p><p>A number of remarkable technologies are converging: clever software, novel materials, more dexterous robots, new processes (notably three-dimensional printing) and a whole range of web-based services. The factory of the past was based on cranking out zillions of identical products: Ford famously said that car-buyers could have any colour they liked, as long as it was black. But the cost of producing much smaller batches of a wider variety, with each product tailored precisely to each customer’s whims, is falling.

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I might be tilting at a strawman of your definition of vibe coding - apologies in advance if so.<p>But LLM-aided development is <i>helping</i> me get my hands dirty.</p><p>Last weekend, I encountered a bug in my Minecraft server. I run a small modded server for my kids and I to play on, and a contraption I was designing was doing something odd.</p><p>I pulled down the mod's codebase, the fabric-api codebase (one of the big modding APIs), and within an hour or so, I had diagnosed the bug and fixed it. Claude was essential in making this possible. Could I have potentially found the bug myself and fixed it? Almost certainly. Would I have bothered? Of course not. I'd have stuck a hopper between the mod block and the chest and just hacked it, and kept playing.</p><p>But, in the process of making this fix, and submitting the PR to fabric, I learned things that might make the next diagnosis or tweak that much easier.</p><p>Of course it took human judgment to find the bug, characterize it, test it in-game. And look! My first commit (basically fully written by Claude) took the wrong approach! [1]</p><p>Through the review process I learned that calling `toStack` wasn't the right approach, and that we should just add a `getMaxStackSize` to `ItemVariantImpl`. I got to read more of the codebase, I took the feedback on board, made a better commit (again, with Claude), and got the PR approved. [2]</p><p>They just merged the commit yesterday. Code that I wrote (or asked to have written, if we want to be picky) will end up on thousands of machines. Users will not encounter this issue. The Fabric team got a free bugfix. I learned things.</p><p>Now, again - is this a strawman of your point? Probably a little. It's not \"vibe coding going straight to production.\" Review and discernment intervened to polish the commit, expertise of the Fabric devs was needed. Sending the original commit straight to \"production\" would have been less than ideal. (arguably better than leaving the bug unfixed, though!)</p><p>But having an LLM help doesn't <i>have</i> to mean that less understanding and instinct is built up. For this case, and for many other small things I've done, it just removed friction and schlep work that would otherwise have kept me from doing something useful.</p><p>This is, in my opinion, a very good thing!</p><p>[1]: <a href=\"https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-api/pull/5220/changes/3e355986821c1cba87fec2cb044894ea6912ac98\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-api/pull/5220/changes/3e3...</a></p><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-api/pull/5220/changes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-api/pull/5220/changes</a></p></div>"

An entry level manual milling machine from Precision Matthews in Taiwan will cost you $250 shipping alone. Even good linear rails by themselves are more than $300 on ebay. A lot of innovation has been happening in the 3D printer space to make all these machine components cheaper which has also benefited other applications like hobbyist milling.<p>Nowadays, we are so used to all the injection molded plastic crap, and also so much poorer, that we can't understand why precisely manufactured products made from solid metal or wood are so expensive.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">What's new is this concept of the \"maker movement\" as a distinct counterculture. It's relatively easy to go buy parts and materials and make things. People 30 or 40 years ago who built stuff instead of buying it didn't really identify as anything because that was just what you did when you wanted something. Whereas nowadays you can buy pretty much anything on Amazon, even things that are fit for a very specific purpose.<p>For example, if you wanted a pretty dress with a specific fabric and cut, you would likely have had to sew it yourself or pay a tailor because your off-the-rack options would be limited, costly, or ill-fitting. But people just did that without fanfare and it wasn't a counterculture. Or if you wanted custom cabinets or resin-coated live-edge stair treads, etc. You'd just figure out how to make it if you wanted it. Or you could pay someone else to do it.</p></div>"

The actual incentives are curiosity and a desire to build what one cannot buy (and using that for teaching initiative in kids) - not AGI or transforming society.<p>Physical making is hard: you run up against the limits of plastic or the difficulty of cnc planning for various materials, as well as the limited value for small projects: people rarely make entire projects, instead making parts.  So there is an upper bound for the utility of making. (btw, anyone have a laser welder or steel-capable CNC's they're tired of?)</p><p>Software making is what you make it, subject to the laws of complexity, and as valuable as its integration (computers, robotics).  These in theory are limiting, but in practice there are effectively an infinite supply of valuable projects when the cost of production reduces.  Deployments will be limited by access to customers, which is not a problem when people make software for themselves.</p></div>"

If that is the case that one was captured by corporations - and for makerbot, the Stratasys “takeover”. I guess the AI/vibe coding was born from corporations but with local models there is this promise to move it to easier/more open access. I feel it’s too soon to tell to trace part of the parallels. I also feel the Maker movement cited was at a better age for Blogs, so lots of the vibe coding may just be happening without an audience.</div>"

Even in regular software there's a feedback mechanism - unit tests go red, CI breaks. Vibe coding skips that too. You get working code that passes the happy path and nothing that tells you which 5% failure rate is the dangerous one. That judgment about problem category severity is the thing that's hard to develop without breaking things first.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">The maker movement is not dead but it's a far more niche audience. Don't get me wrong, get a 3d printer and an arduino(or arduino like equivalent), endure a week of suffering and you are hooked for life: this was my own experience and anyone that I know that has ever gone down that road. ~~vibe~~ Slop coding won't die either but there are a lot of people will get a cold shower sooner or later: some already have. All ai slop is a russian roulette where the players may not even know they are playing and the gun is a backwards revolver. I can't say whether slop coding will professionally die before or after the burst of the AI bubble, but everyone is starting to realize that slop is unmaintainable, inefficient and full of bugs when you factor in all the edge cases no slop machine will ever cover. AI can exist in non-professional spaces and hobby projects, though I'd argue it may be equally as dangerous for the people that use it and those around them: you are only one firewall-cmd away from leaking all your personal data.<p>As for the parallels with the maker movements, here's one example: drones are one of my hobbies. I love drones and I've built countless fpv ones. For anyone that hasn't done that, the main thing to know is that no two self-build drones are the same - custom 3d printed parts, tweaks, tons of fiddling about. The main difference is that while I am self-taught when it comes to drones, I have some decent knowledge in physics, I understand the implications of building a drone and what could go wrong: you won't see me flying any of my drones in the city - you may find me in some remote, secluded area, sure. The point is I am taking precautions to make sure that when I eventually crash my drone(not IF but WHEN), it will be in a tree 10km from anything that breathes. Slop code is something you live with and there are infinite ways to f-up. And way too many people are living in denial.</p></div>"

Any generalizations about what this \"means for society\" are going to be strained by definition.\nThe author partially senses this.

If we still need software engineers to prompt, you'll find plenty of people in India able to do those tasks, not necessarily with great quality until they too are replaced by better AI.</p><p>This whole situation inspired me to actually dive harder into Maker type stuff such as learning how to design PCBs, but one thing I found is that this TOO is very close to being automated by AI. To actually get hardware made, even prototyping PCBs, you NEED to go to China, and the Trump tariffs cut into the cost of doing these activities hard.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">The thing is, the cost of making them at home is both laborious, poorly reproducible, and lower quality than getting it done at JLPCB. In the old days, it was done with an exacto and rubylith. Today it requires a laser setup for about $4000 and you still need to manually apply and remove a resin layer. It's mostly not worth it to do things this way, and you lose the ability to have more than 2 layers in your board.<p>The bigger issue with PCBs is that even with a nice prototype, actual manufacturing needs to be done in Shenzen for any sort of cost competitiveness if you want to step outside of the hobby realm (just as the author of this essay stated).</p><p>It's really, really hard to see where the USA stands in the value chain any more once LLMs have been deployed. If all the physical manufacturing lives in China, where the manufacturing supply chain also lives, and Chinese AI companies can very very easily distill US LLM models, the two remaining US advantages is actually just the dollar's role as reserve currency --- something that crypto bros and the US president is working on eroding at a record pace, and the fact that this overvalued dollar gets all the smart people in China and India to emigrate to the US -- also becoming politically less viable.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">A mix of perspectives in here that feel inter-related. The maker movement state-side leaned more \"fun or artsy\" while the real maker movement you could argue was thriving in China. Another darker way of looking at it is: if the maker movement was really believed to be a way to bring manufacturing back, it was effectively cargo-culting that by focusing only on a narrow set of building blocks. Maybe it's similar to building your own PC from parts at Fry's back at the day: that felt good... and you did feel you were really making something. But you were really doing final assembly and abstracting out the complexity of building those building blocks that went into it.<p>Anyway I think we are seeing a scenius phase -- it's just happening everywhere all at once on a world stage. And it's exciting. As with any moment in time there's a ton of experimentation and a small number of break-out hits. Also the pace of change means there's less staying power for a break-out hit than there used to be.</p><p>But the quick break-out hit phenomenon is particularly applicable for things that are more about the attention economy and less about the boring hidden things that traditionally have been where the economy's silent toil is really centered.</p><p>All of this makes me feel the author is too close to the creative end-consumer layer e.g. \"make something flashy and cool whether it's a 3d-printer in a 5th avenue dept. store window, or a new app front end\" but perhaps less focused on the full depth of things that really exist around them.</p><p>This really resonates with me in that a lot of NYC's \"tech\" circa 2013 was 3d printing oriented, much more so than in Silicon Valley. And I wondered why? but then it was a reflection that tech in NYC <i>then</i> was more about marketing, story telling, and less about the depth...</p><p>Obviously you had the west coast makers, you had the burners, so I don't mean to conflate all these differnet things. But the idea that Maker Faires were really about bringing manufacturing back... I don't know I think it was more about the counterculture, about having fun. I think that's coming back to tech right now as well in a sense. Even if it's also got dystopian overtones</p></div>"

If someone tells me they jogged 100 meters, I don't care at all (unless they were previously crippled or morbidly obese etc.).</p><p>I think there are just a ton of none-engineers who are super hyped right now that they built something/anything, but don't have any internal benchmark or calibration about what is actually \"good\" or \"impressive\" when it comes to software, since they never built anything before, with AI or otherwise.</p><p>Even roughly a year ago, I made a 3D shooting game over an evening using Claude and never bothered sharing it because it seemed like pure slop and far too easy to brag about.

Yes, they played a part in that thing existing, and part of that person is reflected in the output, but I don't think most Makers would say the final output is goal, so what's there to be excited about?<p>It's hard to not be dismissive or gate-keeping with this stuff, my goal isn't to discourage anyone or to fight against the lower barriers to entry, but it's simply a different thing when someone prompts a private AI model to make a thing in an hour.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I don't think it has slowed down; in fact,I think it has grown in the last few years. Sure, it is a niche - and will probably always be - but one never had such a low barrier of entry to build stuff and be creative; you have plenty of very powerful chips, somewhat usable SDKs, a ton of COTS ready to use components ranging from gps sensors to rotary encoders, and you can design your own pcbs and order them cheap from China; you can also design enclosures and 3d print parts in your own home with precision that was only accessible to specialized companies 15 years ago. LLMs are a great help not only on the code generation part, but also on the design part - as an example, I sometimes use ChatGPT to generate openscad functions, and it isn't half-bad.</div>"

I've actually been a longtime Gecko/Firefox user myself, so this one stings a bit.<p>The short answer: Firefox doesn't support the File System Access API (<a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=File+System+Access+API\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://caniuse.com/?search=File+System+Access+API</a>).</p><p>We made a deliberate decision to go client-first. Video editing happens entirely in your browser without us uploading your entire footage on our end. No bandwidth costs for you, no storing your raw video on our servers. The File System Access API is what makes that possible, and unfortunately Firefox just doesn't have it yet.</p><p>It's not a forever thing though. For cloud-based projects where files live on our end anyway, Firefox support is very much on the roadmap. But for the local-first editing flow, our hands are a bit tied until Mozilla ships it.</p><p>Hope that makes sense, and fingers crossed Firefox adds support soon!</p></div>"

As someone who only occasionally needs to edit videos for product / feature reels, I'd happily ask an AI to \"sync the narration to the video, cut away irrelevant footage, and add transitions\". The convenience of being able to automate simple, repeatable tasks in creative software via ai is something that gets overshadowed a lot by the agentic coding discussions. I can only imagine the nightmare it would be for a tool like Premier to integrate effective ai features, so new ai-in-mind tools really feel like a necessity.<p>Great website and good luck!</p></div>"

But for those who are working on commercial or home movies, why not use AI to build a narrative? It can be like throwing dice and the outcome could be OK. Maybe even good.<p>Regardless, having a tool that knows the content of your footage is a huge time saver. Good luck with the product.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I find it easier to understand in terms of the Unix syscall API. `2&gt;&amp;1` literally translates as `dup2(1, 2)`, and indeed that's exactly how it works. In the classic unix shells that's all that happens; in more modern shells there may be some additional internal bookkeeping to remember state. Understanding it as dup2 means it's easier to understand how successive redirections work, though you also have to know that redirection operators are executed left-to-right, and traditionally each operator was executed immediately as it was parsed, left-to-right. The pipe operator works similarly, though it's a combination of fork and dup'ing, with the command being forked off from the shell as a child before processing the remainder of the line.<p>Though, understanding it this way makes the direction of the angled bracket a little odd; at least for me it's more natural to understand dup2(2, 1) as 2&lt;1, as in make fd 2 a duplicate of fd 1, but in terms of abstract I/O semantics that would be misleading.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">US style plugs and derivatives (and Australian, Japanese, Brazilian, etc) - all invented by Hubbell - are \"good enough\".<p>Are they objectively good? No. Do they regularly fail, cause fires, or shock people? No.</p><p>Even my kids when young understood how to grip the plug without touching the metal contacts and to this day still have not been shocked. In theory can something fall and hit the pins just right to cause a short? Sure. You could also get struck by lightning. In practice it just doesn't happen very often.</p><p>For the US/North American NEMA style there are some improvements and some clever things about them. Modern receptacles have shutter doors that stop you from putting anything into the holes unless the ground pin or neutral pin unlocks it first. Many plugs also cover the rear part of the hot/neutral with plastic so if the plug is not fully inserted there is no exposed metal.</p><p>The plugs also prevent mixing voltage and amperage. The typical two vertical blades (5-15) are for 15 amp circuits. 20 amp circuits (5-20) have one horizontal + one vertical blade. The receptacle has a T shaped slot to match - that way you can plug a low-amp device into a high-amp circuit but not the reverse.</p><p>Similarly the 240v version of this plug (6-15/6-20) has the same property: 15amp and 20amp versions. The 15 amp is two horizontal blades. The 20 amp is one horizontal + 1 vertical but swapped places compared to the 120v version. I do wish more builders installed the 240v receptacles in kitchens in the US. There is no technical reason we can't have higher power kettles and whatnot. If code required these in garages and kitchens more appliances would be available for them.</p><p>(I find it insane that Brazil continues to be dual exclusive voltage; all of North America is dual concurrent voltage. Every home/office has 120v and 240v available. In Brazil it depends on what state/city you live in - some get 120v, some get 240v. Even worse they use the same standard plug design for both so you'd better hope the plug is the right color or has the right sticker. And you can't be sure you can take electrical appliances from one city to the next! At least they should have adopted different plugs for different voltages.)</p><p>The huge advantage of these plugs is compatibility. We already have them. The cost to change designs is massive. The benefit extremely small. It just isn't worth doing.</p><p><i>Note: The 240v NEMA plugs I am referencing are not \"dryer plugs\" which are physically </i>much* larger and designed for much higher amp loads in the 30-60 range. The 6-15/6-20 are literally identical to the standard 120v plugs but with different blade orientations. They were designed to support 240v appliances in everyday use since all of North America is dual voltage. In practice 240v is only ever used for large appliances like ovens so the 6 series doesn't get much use which is a bit of a shame.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I was looking for a good TUI tool for diffs recently, but I'm not sure yet if what I want exists already (and I don't think this tool does it (yet?)). I've been moving my workflow out of VSCode as I'm using TUI-driven coding agents more often lately but one thing I miss from my VSCode/GitHub workflow is the ability to provide a comment on lines or ranges in a diff to provide targeted feedback to the agent. Most diff tools seem to be (rightfully) focused on cleanly visualizing changes and not necessarily iterating on the change.<p>I admit I haven't looked super hard yet, I settled on configuring git to use delta [0] for now and I'm happy with it, but I'm curious if anyone has a workflow for reviewing/iterating on diffs in the terminal that they'd be willing to share. Also  open to being told that I'm lightyears behind and that there's a better mental model for this.</p><p>[0] <a href=\"https://github.com/dandavison/delta/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/dandavison/delta/</a></p></div>"

Takes a completely different approach - parses syntax trees instead of lines, so indentation changes and bracket shuffles don't show up as noise. Worth a look if you're comparing options.</p><p>Main question I'd have: how does it hold up on large files? 5k+ line diffs are where most of these tools either choke or produce unreadable output.

There might have been app stores that collected apps but I don't remember ever using any.</p><p>I had apps for everything the same as today. Even though the screen was only like 160x240 and the internet was 14.4k, I had browser &amp; email of course, but also ssh, irc, I even had a vnc client! Audible.com player, countless random things like a netmask calculator, resistor color code app, a few different generic db apps where you design your own fields and input/display screens etc. 3rd party phone dialer that integrated the contacts db. I must be forgetting a hundred other things.</p><p>The OS wasn't open source but at least the apps could be, so pretty much like windows &amp; mac.</p><p>All in all I'd prefer Android where the entire system is open, except Google has somehow managed to make the real world life with Android less open than PalmOS was, even though PalmOS wasn't open source and I think even the development system wasn't free either.</p><p>I think the \"somehow\" is the extremely integrated app store. Previously, if there were any app stores, they didn't really matter. It didn't hurt you not to be in them because hardly any users were either. But today it's basically just a technicality to say that you don't have to be in the official app store, and not even theoretically/technically true in many cases.</p></div>"

I'm trying to synthesize the best parts of every computer interaction method, primarily focusing on desktops but looking at mobile designs as well.<p>There are 2 principle reasons for this project:\n1. UNIX desktops objectively suck compared to their Mac and Windows cousins, either being too complex to learn and bombarding the user with options (KDE, XFCE) or being so dumbed down and rigid to be actually usable (GNOME, to a lesser extend CDE)\n2. I'm a massive fan of the GNU project and the way it designs software and none of the current desktops integrate well with it (EG: texinfo manuals, emacs-y keybinds, A wealth of customization if you want it but otherwise easy to pick up and use)</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I love KDE, especially since Plasma 6 release but oh man is the Settings program poorly designed and littered with settings 99% of users will never need.<p>So many options placed seemingly at random. Similar options like lockscreen, login screen and desktop background settings spread out over 3 different main categories.</p><p>Customization options so extensive and granular one can only wonder about their purpose. Even in their latest release blog post they chose to brag about the new ability to change intensity/thickness of frames. I don't think most people care about stuff like this.</p><p>Until recently defaults were straight up insane like single click to open folders/launch programs, touchpad scroll being inverted etc.</p><p>If you navigate to Settings -&gt; Sound you'll be presented with some options but also buttons in the top right that will open a mostly empty screen with a few additional options. Why not split the whole page into parts and present everything on a single screen? Why not tabs?</p><p>Sometimes those buttons in the top right have different behavior. Some will open a whole new page ansd sometimes it's just a popup and other times it's a dropdown.</p><p>And oh man just navigating Settings sucks. Main list consists of single and two level options with two level options opening another, mostly empty vertical pane so the actual size of the right pane changes with top text jumping around depending on what you press. So why some settings have two levels and some have tabs and some have those junky top right buttons that need their own back button to show up in the interface whenever they're pressed? I'm not for or against any of those design choices but why all of them at random? I just want some goddamn consistency.</p><p>Cherry on top is the bloat most distros choose to install alongside Plasma desktop. Dragon Player? kMail? Does anyone even use these? I dislike Gnome a lot but at least their preinstalled software is minimal, elegant and actively supported/developed. Most KDE programs look like they stopped receiving updates in 2008.</p><p>I still think it's a great DE but there's much room for improvement.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">The wealth of things in the KDE settings are things people will likely never change or are things that can be tweaked but don't necessarily need to be. For example, let's look at GNOMEs settings app. It has menus and options for all the things that the average user needs (network settings, mouse and display options, etc.) but leaves out, for example, things that people need to change for specific workflows (like the option to have focus follow the mouse). A settings app should let the user set things needed for the functions of a computer to work properly while separating deeper level customization for those who want it.<p>I think emacs does a very good job at this. You can configure most of the settings people need to be productive in a text editor from the menu bar while leaving the extremely rich customization of emacs to the options menu and elisp config files</p></div>"

The friends-of-friends icon is going to appear widely but it'll all be a single edge away from Jacques' node. Is that much of a signal? I dunno. That's 30 seconds of thought about it.

I was talking about setting up a parallel veilid connection - a private route exchange between the two ends that goes straight over the veilid network, outside of tor. It's got comparable privacy and security assurance. There only a few thousand nodes/peers right now, but it's gaining steam.<p>You could use tor to anchor a common relay, then do key and route exchange to establish veilid, then the realtime app uses that for a very secure private route unique to the two endpoints.</p><p>From what I can tell, because of the design, veilid would be excellent, comparable to many commercial voip offerings, with 150-500ms latency . More nodes and users would quickly ramp that up. There are a ton of downstream benefits of something like this; faster file exchange for ipfs, bittorent, etc, that doesn't gum up the tor layer, a kind of implicit defense in depth, but also low latency, efficient peer to peer routing.</p><p>It'd almost be zero knowledge by construction; you could build a multi-hop escrow style key exchange.</p><p>If Musk integrated tor relays and veilid peers throughout Starlink, you could get near-native latency for wherever you connect in the world, more than enough to add timing attack noise and layer in other security features.</p></div>"

A standard real time call your able to interject and talk over someone and this works because of the low latency. The other person can stop talking and the conversation still flows.</p><p>The latency from Tor just makes it awkward to the point that you have to almost relearn how to have a conversation since by the time your interjecting and they hear the interjection, a whole 6 seconds may have passed and they may already be on a whole other train of thought. Walkie talkie architecture just forces you to listen and digest the message, think, respond.</p><p>There are two layers of encryption here. Tor, which already is encrypting the data, and locally via openssl before transmit.</p><p>I have 21 ciphers programed in from the openSSL library. There's a lot more available in the library but these are supposedly the strongest. The cipher used is not secret so while in the call you can see your cipher, and the remote cipher real time.</p><p>The authentication is resting entirely in the users lap. It's up to them how to come up with key exchange.</p><p>For me, I would be comfortable enough knowing the other side is who I think it is by the simple fact that audio is passing through. Establishing a connection once in person is most ideal.</p><p>Because the .onion is derived on device, an attacker can't just forge that. You need also need the private key for a connection to be established.</p><p>Let's say an attacker copies the directory from one of the endpoints and has the private key now and can launch tor under your static address. Well, because the additional shared secret is encrypted with another password known only to the user it's useless. The other side will not be receiving forged audio because of this barrier. They may get as far as being in a call, but no audio is going to be played back because the shared secret was successful protected. Even if you pass your message to the attacker, decryption will fail and nothing will pass.</p><p>Directly after sending, we run rm -f on $raw_file, $opus_file, $enc_file.</p><p>Audio is recived to /audio folder. After audio is decrypted and played we run rm -f $enc_file, $dec_file. There is only a split second that it lives on disk until it's gone.</p></div>"

Even the common elements like DAGs cause most people's eyes to immediately glaze over.<p>Managers and executives are happy to hear that you made the builds faster or more reliable, so the infra people who care about this kind of thing don't waste time on design docs and instead focus on getting to a minimum prototype that demonstrates those improved metrics. Once you have that, then there's buy-in and the project is made official... but by then the bones have already been set in place, so design documentation ends up focused on the more visible stuff like user interface, storage formats, etc.</p><p>OTOH, bazel (as blaze) was a very intentionally designed second system at Google, and buildx/buildkit is similarly a rewrite of the container builder for Docker, so both of them should have been pretty free of accidental engineering in their early phases.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Martin from GitHub here.  This type of behaviour is explicitly against the GitHub terms of service, when we catch the accounts doing this we can (and do) take action against those accounts including banning the accounts. It's a game of whack-a-mole for sure, and it's not just start-ups that take part in this sketchy behaviour to be honest. I've been plenty of examples in my time across the board.<p>The fundamental nature of Git makes this pretty easy for folks to scrape data from open source repositories.  It's against our terms of service and those folks might want to talk with some lawyers about doing it - but as every Git commit contains your name and email address in the commit data it's not technically difficult even if it is unethical.</p><p>From the early days we've added features to help users anonymise their email addresses for commits posted to GitHub.  Basically, you configure your local Git client to use your 'no-reply' email address in commits and that still links back to your GitHub account when you push: <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/reference/email-addresses-reference#your-noreply-email-address\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/reference/ema...</a></p><p>I think that's still probably the best route. We want to keep open source data as open as possible, so I don't think locking down API's etc is the right route. We do throttle API requests and scraping traffic, but then again there have been plenty of posts here over the years from people annoyed at hitting those limits so it's definitely a balancing act. Love to know what folks here think though.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Some random predictions about what AI image generation tools will do/are doing to art:<p>1. The narrative/life of the artist becomes a lot more important. The most successful artists are ones that craft a story around their life and art, and don't just create stuff and stop. This will become even more important.</p><p>2. Originality matters more than ever. By design, these tools can only copy and mix things that already exist. But they aren't alive, they don't live in the world and have experiences, and they can't create something truly new.</p><p>3. Those that bother to learn the actual art skills, and not merely prompting, will increasingly be miles ahead of everyone else. People are lazy, and bothering to put in the time to actually learn stuff will stand out more and more. (Ditto for writing essays and other writing people are doing with AI.)</p><p>4. Taste continues to be the single most important thing. The vast, vast majority of AI art out there is...not very good. It's not going to get better, because the lack of taste isn't a technical problem.</p><p>5. Art with physical materials will become increasingly popular. That is, stuff that can't be digitized very well: sculpture, installation art, etc. Above all, AI art is <i>uncool</i>, which means it has no real future as a leading art form. This uncoolness will push people away from the screen and towards things that are more material.</p></div>"

It's not going to get better, because the lack of taste isn't a technical problem.</p><p>Engineers are in business of converting non-technical problems into technical ones. Just like AI now is way more capable than it was 20 years ago, and able to write interesting texts and make interesting pictures - something which at the time wasn't considered a technical problem - with time what we perceive as \"taste\" may likely improve.</p><p>&gt; 5... Above all, AI art is uncool, which means it has no real future as a leading art form.</p><p>AI critics are for a long time mistaking the level with trend.

Hence the constant generic slop images of Impressionism or some other already-existing art style.<p>I suspect here we have underlying disagreement regarding assumption that AI - in general, not necessarily today's models - isn't qualitatively different than human mind. The part \"Originality comes from humans experiencing the world and interacting with it\" isn't an accepted truth, and even today AIs do interact, in a limited sense, with the world - so \"None, of course\" is questionable. And even if so, concluding \"Hence... slop...\" seems like a jump in reasoning. For example, why don't you think this slop is more like child's early paintings? Just because today's AIs have limited means to learn in the process?</p><p>&gt; I think you missed my point about it being uncool. It’s not about critics, it’s about culture at large.</p><p>What it is about culture at large? SpaceX analogy was brought to illustrate how much arguments about AI incapabilities are applicable today, but not necessarily tomorrow - just like arguments about SpaceX inability to reach a particular goal quite a few times turned out to be a matter of - not so long - time.</p><p>I agree that many AI results today can be uncool. But how do you know it's not passing the uncanny valley period? How can you know they can't be cool eventually?</p><p>&gt; people obviously go watch movies because they like the actor/director involved. It’s not really clear why anyone would care about an AI actor.</p><p>Let me stretch a little to illustrate here. Imagine \"personal\" experiences of AI - making AIs unique. One of those AIs consistently produces good movies, which, if you're honestly don't judge by the authorship - are actually good. Yes, people may not care about non-existent AI actors, but they may still care about existent AI author :) . Do you think it's impossible?</p><p>&gt; People want to watch people, not imitations of them.</p><p>How can you tell the difference? You're watching a movie with actors who are not familiar to you. Would you refuse to watch just for this reason? You just came to somebody's party, and here's a movie going on, and you watched it to the end, because it looked interesting, and you don't know anything about producers, actors etc. - you still can talk about the movie, will you be predominantly worried that it's \"AI slop\" even if it looks great? Suspiciously great maybe?</p><p>&gt; The rest of your comments seem to be summarized as “it has gotten better and therefore it will eventually solve all problems it has now.” Which may be true in a technical sense, but again this is not taste.</p><p>It's hard to define taste, to be honest. People can definitely have different tastes, almost by definition. But more importantly - why do you think AI products may not have tastes?</p><p>&gt; At this point I think identifying a work as AI-created makes people instantly devalue it. We are rapidly approaching the point where no one wants to admit something is AI-created, because it comes with negative perceptions.</p><p>Yes. But doesn't it look like a prejudice? Of course we can point to how many times we looked at it and didn't get some perceived value out of the work, and got annoyed that we spent time and efforts, but didn't get some results - but what if we'll mostly get results from AI works? Do you think that's impossible?</p></div>"

And AI isn't anything new there. I have a friend who gets commissioned by hotels to do one-off pieces for display all over the world. People have been making knockoff pieces of her style and selling them for at least a decade.

I have witnessed both first hand and the criticisms were verbatim the same as AI.<p>They said you couldn't become a good photographer if you didn't learn it with the limitation of film that forced you to make each shot count. Photoshopping a picture made it \"not a real photo\" and was banned from online communities and irl events, drawing in photoshop was not considered art. I find it very ironic that digital artists are repeating the exact same argument as the one used against their art</p></div>"

Or for you to experience a novel dream? I would argue yes. You can know the rules of the environment and the starting conditions, but with a bit of randomness (or not) you can generate from that novel experiences which were unexpected - so too from the data &amp; distribution that AIs are already trained on they can experience new experiences.</p><p>Another source of novelty is from good verifiers/recognition of a class of object which is hard to construct but easy to verify - here the AI can search and from that obtain novel solutions which were unthought of before.</p><p>N.B novelty itself is basically trivial - just generate random strings.

My architect did an OK job, but the details that Nano Banana added really bring the house up a notch. I just do hundreds of renders from the basic 3D models and I find looks that I like and iterate from there. We are implementing the renders from Nano Banana over our Interior Designers designs. We would not have hired the Interior Designers again after using Nano Banana to do our interiors.<p>I think part of the issue with architects and designers today is that they use CAD too much. It's easy to design boxes and basic roof lines in CAD. It's harder to put in curves and more craftsman features.

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I started with sketchup to make basic floor plans and house shapes. I had a rough idea of the style of the home. I picked \"Transitional English Estate\" since the build site is out on a farm that sorta looks like the Cotswolds. I used AI in this process to get rough renders and feedback on the floorplan. I then took that basic floorplan and house dimensions to a Draftsman who did a lot of tweaking to get it up to code and fix issues. I got his plans and took it to a Sketchup Pro on Fivver . They made a detailed sketchup model. I then took that model and took screenshots from different perspectives and tweaked the prompt to get renders I liked. These changes were reencorprated into the blueprints. I did the same thing with the interior. Took screenshots from sketchup and put them into AI and tweaked the prompt. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/lSIYTYr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/lSIYTYr</a></div>"

They were rare, and special, and you'd have a few photos per YEAR to look back on. The feel of photos back then, was at least 100x stronger than now. They were a special item, could be given as a gift. But once they became freely available that same amount of emotion is now split across many thousands of photos. (not saying this is good or bad, just increased supply reducing value of each item)</p><p>With image/art generation the same thing will happen and I can already feel it happening. Things that used to be beautiful or fantastic looking now just feel flat and AI-ish. If claymation scenes can be generated in 1s, and I see a million claymation diagrams a year, then claymation will lose its charm. If I see a million fake Tom Cruise videos, then it oversaturates my desire for desire for all Tom Cruise movies.</p><p>What a time to be alive.</p></div>"

A photographer sharing their 'best' photos was some combination of sharing their personal perspective and their effort to capture shared memories on behalf of others. So yeah it was a limited/privileged (often patriarchal) role. What they picked was interpretive, but that curation was part of the expression/information the viewer was experiencing.<p>We can mix and match the media we choose to view or keep so easily, when previously there was so much more material and opportunity cost to choosing what to shoot, develop, keep, and share. I think that inevitably loses some meaning.</p></div>"

Although many models cannot do this well, their abilities get better each day and can allow you to compose or edit/modify a photo in such a way that matches your internal feelings rather than the blandness of what is essentially a random photo of random stuff that may or may not convey an emotion anywhere near to what I was feeling or remember feeling in that moment.</p></div>"

Additionally, printing out a photo of you and your partner and gifting it to them has the same weight as going through childhood photo. A scrapbook of a recent vacation filled with printed digital photos evokes memories just as vividly as one from the 80s. On the flip side of this, a photo in a box in the basement has the same weight as a photo sitting in the cloud.</p><p>I'll offer you some more food for thought: are Aardman Animations films charming because they use claymation?

The dwindling stock of unused true Polaroid film is getting absurdly expensive as a result.<p>The one factory you refer to was the last one, and was purchased by the Impossible Project (now Polaroid BV).

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I think of it more as that AI will destroy the profit motive in all things, not just art. What we used to think of as talent/skill/experience will no longer be scarce, because anyone will be able to make anything with a prompt. The perceived value will be in wholes built of valueless parts (gestalts).<p>AI is incompatible with capitalism, but the world isn't ready for that. So we'll have a prolonged period of intense aggregation where more and more value is attributed to systems of control that already have more than they could ever spend, long after the free parts could have provided for basic human needs.</p><p>In other words, the masters existed because they had benefactors and a market for their art and inventions. Today there are better artists and inventors toiling in obscurity, but they won't be remembered because they merely make rent. Which gets harder every day, so there's a kind of deification of the working class hero NPC mindset and simultaneously no bandwidth for ingenuity (what we once thought of as divine inspiration).</p><p>Terence McKenna predicted this paradox that the future's going to get weirder and weirder back in 1998:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KZ2ZtTsHqO0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KZ2ZtTsHqO0</a></p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">There are many places in general office work where you need some kind of graphics. Slides, reports, info graphics, dataviz. Or academic papers. Some are just illustrations, like a fancy clipart or stock photos, some are drafts for a proper tikz or svg or something that you then redo in draw.io etc. There is much more use for graphics than the use cases where people would ever even consider hiring an actual artist. I've seen good results for iterating on eg model architecture figures quickly between PhD students and supervisors, faster than dragging boxes around and fiddling with tikz. Obviously you don't simply paste the result into the paper. You redo it but it's a good discussion basis. That's for info graphics stuff. But the same can apply to creative stuff, like an event poster, an invitation card to your wedding, storyboards, mood boards, DIY interior design, outfit planning etc etc</div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Same answers you'd use beyond \"we don't want to pay an engineer\". 100x shorter iteration speed, and the associated workflow (stream of microrevisions and spaghetti throwing), top quartile outputs in many langs/styles/contexts without having to source, hire, and maintain a fleet of separate specialists who can quit when they feel like it.<p>I'm torn on the scale thing. It definitely seems net negative. But I think we collectively underestimate just how deeply sick the <i>existing</i> thing already is. We're repulsed by image gen at scale because it breaks our expectation that images are at least somewhat based on reality, that they reflect the natural world or what we can really expect from a product, from a company, from the future. But that was already a bad expectation: when's the last time you saw a mcdonalds meal that looked like the advert? Or a sub-30$ amazon product that wasn't a complete piece of shit? Advertisements were <i>already</i> actively malicious fantasies to exploit the way our brains react to pictures. They're just fantasies that required whole teams of humans doing weird bullshit with lighting and photoshop, and I'm not sure that's much better. It was already slop. All the grieving we do about the loss of truth, or the extent to which corps will gleefully spray us with mind-breaking waterfalls of outright lies, I think those ships sailed a long time ago. The disgust, deceit, the rage we feel about genAI slop is the way we should have felt about all commercials since at least the 80s IMO.</p></div>"

So my guess is that they are working in parallel, on different arches, and try out stuff on -flash first (since they're smaller and faster to train) and then apply the learnings to -pro training runs. (same thing kinda happened with 2.5-flash that got better upgrades than 2.5-pro at various points last year). Ofc I might be wrong, but that's my guess right now.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I think the fact that it is not possible to put hard spending caps on API keys might be ruled illegal by some EU court soon enough, at least when they sell to consumers (given the explosion of vibecoding end-users making some apps). When I use OpenAI, Openrouter etc., I can put 10 $ on my API key, and when the key leaks, someone can use these 10 $ and that's it. With Google, there is no way to do that - there are extremely complicated \"billing alerts\" <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/advanced-billing-alerts-logic\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/advanced-b...</a> , but these are time-delayed e-mails and there is no out of the box way to do the straightforward thing, which is to actually turn off the tap automatically once a budget is spent. The only native way to set a limit enforced immediately is by rate limiting - but I didn't see params which made it safe while usable in my case.<p>(a legal angle might be the Unfair Contract Terms Directive in the EU, though plenty of individual countries have their own laws that may apply to my understanding. A quite equivalent situation were the \"bill shock\" situations for mobile phone users, where people went on vacation and arrived home to an outrageously high roaming bill that they didn't understand they incurred. This is also limited today in the EU; by law, the service must be stopped after a certain charge is incurred)</p></div>"

I actually complained and they told me that they allow the \"final query\" to complete rather than cutting it off mid-process, which is of course silly, because Claude Code is typically used for long sessions, where the benefit of being cut off 52% into the task rather than 51% into it is essentially meaningless.</p><p>I ended up paying for these so far, but would hope that someone with more free time sues them on it.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Another takeaway: if Google can become a shell of what it once was (in terms of institutional competence, I assume you mean; Alphabet market cap seems to be doing just fine), so can your organization. As such: making something that <i>isn't</i> supposed to be part of your security strategy, <i>look like it could be</i>, is actually a long-term security <i>risk</i>. Sooner or later a new team will not read your own documentation, and jump to wrong conclusions. Also, it probably trains a bad security posture into your users. How many inexperienced devs saw that it was safe and expected (and apparently even required) to leave these keys out in the open, and concluded that the same logic might apply to someone <i>else's</i> API keys?<p>I think this was much less likely to happen without the needless obfuscation. If the only purpose is to identify what project the data is for, and you're trusting the client to report that value, and counseling the client to use that value in a way that trivially exposes it to everyone... <i>what is the point</i> of making it look like cryptic garbage? Just use the account signup name or something, and <i>don't call it a \"key\"</i> in your query parameters. Keys are supposed to unlock stuff. A name tag is not a key.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">A thing I’ve learned about market cap in tech recently is that actually very little needs to get done on the core product. The momentum behind the <i>brand</i> is what carries the stock through time. The brand becomes its own compounding monetary instrument. Google had built a very very strong brand over the last 25 years or so. Only now is that starting to shift away from them. Because of that, I think we’ll start seeing them take more bold risks or they’ll be crushed by the weight of their own bureaucracy. This also tends to be the same reason startups can disrupt so swiftly.<p>An oversimplified version is this: So there are two core very critical components to the mid/late-phase tech megacorp strategy, you need to protect the core money printing product at all cost first and sustain that fiercely over a long period of time (decade+), then use any and all profits to find/fund the next cash cow, looking for optionality. While doing that, grow the market or consume a larger share of market. Google benefited from mainly the latter two and all while the internet blew up globally, funneling even more money into the machine.</p><p>It’s no secret that nearly every Google product that wasn’t search, lost them money. They were searching for the next big thing. They likely were some of the first to see AI as exactly that but moved too slowly to commercialize. Likely because of bureaucracy risk and also perhaps some sense of altruism in knowing the cataclysmic impacts AI could have. There have been plenty of former Google employees confirming this.</p><p>They also used to do things just to be cool, but those days have been long gone since Larry Page tapped out (and probably a few years before that, about a decade). Since then they’ve almost completely lost sight of what made them so successful that nobody even knows their vision or identity as a company today. These don’t correlate to market cap but they do silently lead to stagnation.</p><p>Their brand protects them from quite a lot but it’s not invincible.</p></div>"

Obviously once you put them in your client they are of zero value in helping Google/Stripe identify you. The fact that Google allows you to use the same type of key they also use elsewhere to identify _you_ not _them_ was always incredibly bad design.

But there's something about the concentration of them here that feels like AI - the uncanny valley feeling.</p><p>I would put money on this post at least having gone through AI review, if not having been generated by AI from human-written notes.

          "<div class=\"commtext c5A\">OK I've seen many people make this point on this site over just the last few months, but where do you think LLMs pick up these patterns? How did this rule of threes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)</a> get into the LLM so they are so damn recognizable as LLMs and not as humans?<p>HN Note: Yes the rule of threes is broader than just this particular pattern here, but in my opinion this common writing and communication pattern is a specific example of the rule of threes.</p><p>Punchy repetition in a set of 3. Yes. LLMs are able to capably mimic the common patterns that how to write books have suggested for the last 100 years as ways to make your writing more \"impactful\" and attention-grabbing. So are humans. They learned it from watching us.</p><p>I am a little bit worked up on this as I have felt insulted a couple times at having something I've written been accused of being by an LLM, in that case it was because I had written something from the viewpoint of a depressed and tired character and someone thought it had to be an LLM because they seemed detached from humanity! Success!</p><p>I too would like to be able to reliably detect when something has been written by an LLM so I can discount it out of hand, but frankly many of the attempts I see people make to detect these things seem poorly reasoned and actively detrimental.</p><p>People have learned in classes and from reading how to improve their writing. LLMs have learned from ingesting our output. If something matches a common writing 101 tip it is just as likely to be reasonably competent as it is to be non-human. The solution to escape being labelled an LLM is not to become less competent as a writer.</p><p>I have been overly verbose here, as I am somewhat worked up and angry and it is too late in the morning to go back to sleep but really too early to be awake. I know verbosity is also a symptom of being an LLM, but not giving a damn is a symptom of humanity.</p></div>"

For example, it's common for LLMs to respond with \"You're absolutely right!\" to every second message, which isn't what humans usually do. It's a result of some kind of RLHF: human labelers liked to hear that they're right, so they preferred answers containing such phrases, and those responses became amplified. People recognize LLM-generated writing because LLMs' pattern distribution is different from the actual pattern distribution found in articles written by humans.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c5A\">The fact that according to this reply section most of HN can't tell means that predictably, all hope is lost and there's no point in writing anything by hand any more if you're in it for money/engagement.<p>While writing this I suddenly realized that marketers and writers probably do a better job at recognizing it than developers and engineers, so maybe all hope isn't.</p><p>For those who want to know the tells: overall cadence and frequency of patterns - especially <i>infrequency</i> of patterns - are the biggest ones. And that means that we can't actually give you the best tells, because they're more about what is absent than what is present. What's absent is a single sentence pattern that falls completely <i>out</i> of the LLM go-toes. Anything human written has at most a good mix of both. LLM-written text just entirely lacks it. Humans do use the LLM-preferred patterns, but not for every single sentence. But anyway, here we go.</p><p>&gt; Transparently, the initial triage was frustrating; the report was dismissed as \"Intended Behavior”. But after providing concrete evidence from Google's own infrastructure, the GCP VDP team took the issue seriously.</p><p>^ Fun fact - The \";\" would've originally been an em-dash but was either rewritten or a rule was included for this.</p><p>&gt; Then Gemini arrived.</p><p>^ Dramatic short sentences, a pattern with magnitudes higher LLM-frequency than human frequency, but hasn't reached the public conscious yet a la \"not just X but Y\".</p><p>&gt; No warning. No confirmation dialog. No email notification.</p><p>^ Another such pattern. Not just because it's three of them, but also because of the content and repetition. Humans rarely write like that because it again sounds overly dramatic. It's something you see in fiction rather than a technical writeup. In a thriller.</p><p>&gt; Retroactive Privilege Expansion. You created a Maps key three years ago and embedded it in your website's source code, exactly as Google instructed. Last month, a developer on your team enabled the Gemini API for an internal prototype. Your public Maps key is now a Gemini credential. Anyone who scrapes it can access your uploaded files, cached content, and rack up your AI bill. Nobody told you.</p><p>This style of scenario writing is another one.</p><p>&gt; Nobody told you.</p><p>Absolute drama queen.</p><p>&gt;The UI shows a warning about \"unauthorized use,\" but the architectural default is wide open.</p><p>Again.</p><p>&gt; The attacker never touches your infrastructure. They just scrape a key from a public webpage.</p><p>Again.</p><p>&gt; These aren't just hobbyist side projects. The victims included major financial institutions, security companies, global recruiting firms, and, notably, Google itself.</p><p>..</p><p>&gt; A key that was deployed years ago for a completely benign purpose had silently gained full access to a sensitive API without any developer intervention.</p><p>Surprised it hasn't gained consciousness by now. Maybe that's a future plot point.</p><p>Here's a great example to train your skills on, because it's rare in that the ratio of \"human : straight from LLM\" increased gradually as the article goes on: <a href=\"https://www.wallstreetraider.com/story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.wallstreetraider.com/story.html</a></p><p>It started at heavy human editing (or just human-written), but less and less towards the end.</p><p>The author confirmed this upon pointing it out, FWIW [0].</p><p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47013150\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47013150</a></p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">This seems only partially correct. If by \"they\" you mean Germans then yes, Heroin was engineered by them, or at least first made commercially available by Bayers. The US government had nothing to do with it. It was marketed as a less addictive alternative to morphine although I highly doubt anyone who made it actually believed it was safer. I have no source for this but I think it is a safe assumption to make.<p>The temperance movement was mainly related to alcohol. There were groups who wanted abstinence from everything but that was not its primary focus. They may have played a part in said act but I don't know. They were definitely not the driving force behind it though. Racism played a bigger role than the temperance movement. The government was also aware there was a very real problem with drug addiction.</p></div>"

We still remember how it ended last time!</p><p>1) But ... pain medication helps against anything. From headaches to hernia to bone cancer (of course in some cases it's in a \"die somewhat dignified\" sense). And in quite a few cases it's the only thing that helps ... In the medical sense of \"helping\", after all medicine can't make people live forever so that can't be the goal. The goal is better quality of life, ie. mostly longer life, including the ability to live (think \"sing, dance and play tennis\") ... and not life at any cost.</p><p>The problem here is that this is an entirely correct argument. Some diseases are either incredibly painful or long-term painful. Bone cancer or hernia can serve as examples. We cannot really help such people (by that I mean: not in a way that the pain stops). So can we at least make their life livable?</p><p>2) This pain medication sure helps these very seriously ill people well. But X suffering is at least as bad as bone cancer! X then is everything from still serious diseases, psychological suffering, and of course this then goes down and down until someone points out pain medication also helps existential dread and lackluster parties.</p><p>Again, all of that ... is true. That's not the problem.</p><p>3) The medication becomes the problem. Mostly because of what people do to get money for their fix (and the crime, prostitution, ... that it leads to). But this is not the only problem. It makes people who broke a bone last week go skiing again. And ... I'm almost afraid to say it but you can increase the effect of morphine ... by damaging yourself. You can guess how that ends.</p><p>The problem is that pain medication, irrespective of whether it's physically (\"biologically\") addictive is addictive. Anybody who's had a serious pain for a week, say kidney stones, knows that they would have sacrificed their favorite cat for it to stop. The problem is not just that morphine is addictive. The problem is the pain, and the fact that pain medication is a temporary non-fix.</p><p>4) The medication becomes the problem, but doesn't just affect patients. It goes from \"you know this funny thing happened to my niece ... and she did it to herself ...\" to it destroys families, neighborhoods, childhoods ...</p><p>Result: ONLY ONE SOLUTION! ZERO TOLERANCE!</p><p>GOTO 1.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Except even as the press release states right off the bat, Fentanyl is efficacious, cost-efficient, and can be made widely available in areas like the global south without extensive pharmaceutical production infrastructure in place. The overdose crisis is in fact not really something that came out of the drug itself, just as the prevalence of Oxycodone before the enforced policy change shifted the usage patterns into a far more dangerous direction in heroin and tar and then, adulterated versions with fentanyl. People who are prescribed fentanyl for pain are not dying in droves. If you've had surgery, you may have been given fentanyl. If you're reading this, you, like most people, survived it just fine.<p>The crisis is one created by policy and cannot be eliminated on the pharmaceutical end. This isn't a case of methanol being sold as ethanol or SSRIs having less than ideal efficacy rates while causing widespread sexual dysfunction at a rate much higher than originally thought, or Zolpidem leading to over a hundred observational notes published in medical journals describing dangerous activity performed even on small doses followed by anterograde amnesia that certainly is a real thing that is also potentially dangerous, but incredibly difficult to study. Those effects are happening when the medication is taken as prescribed Do people take those without prescriptions? Of course, but one assumes the risk, and also, anyone ever seen a Zoloft pill mill?</p><p>Fentanyl had been diverted in small quantities onto black market supply chains for as long as it has been available. You can absolutely get an Actiq Pop in 2006 if you really wanted it, and the thing is a lollipop for crying out loud. It didn't cause widespread overdoses, it didn't even cause any significant black market demand. It was at best a curiosity. It's hard to quantify a subjective experience, but generally it was regarded as \"not fun\" anecdotally. Heroin is fun. Hydromorphone is even more fun but the best ROA leaves you with a 5-10 minute high at best and takes about that much time to prep. Oxycodone was fun but since the DEA made sure that it was as difficult to obtain as possible all of a sudden and what was available was spiked with enough APAP so that your liver might give out before you overdosed, well, what does cutting off the supply but leaving the demand in place do? The crisis as we know it today was inevitable in some form. It's created by policy, which is not set by scientists, and in fact when hydrocodone/APAP was rescheduled for Schedule II a specific reply to patient access concerns was \"we don't take that into account\", according to the DEA. Thanks for the candor, sadly we've gotten very little of it in the years since.</p><p>But of course, even on the black market, people overdose in a manner that is to a degree predictable. Long term users with steady supplies - say, everyone who's on a benzodiazepine long term - aren't overdosing regularly (yes, the LD50 of benzodiazepines generally makes overdosing on it alone very difficult if not impossible, but kicking it cold turkey does actually cause deaths from seizures and when mixed with another depressant like alcohol it becomes almost trivial to overdose on it, arguably making it at least in theory a more dangerous drug if one takes the view of the DEA). They are mostly able to obtain legitimate, low cost, and frequently entirely legal versions of, well, name the variety. From Triazolam (3 hour half life) to Midazolam (water soluble) to Etizolam (scheduled into schedule I based on 4 cases in Norway where when mixed with another depressant patients ended up in the ER. All survived and were discharged almost immediately. The reason why the DEA laundered cases in Norway through the FDA to justify at first an emergency scheduling and then turned it into a permanent one? Because they couldn't  find any cases that demonstrated the purported danger in the US or Canada.) Overdoses happen when someone takes too much of a substance, but \"too much\" is difficult to determine when you don't have a reliable supplier in terms of quality and adulteration, but also, because tolerance gets built up so that long term users can use prodigious amounts and be just fine. But how do we make sure that nobody knows where their tolerance is at? Non-medically assisted, pseudoscientific \"sobriety help\" like AA or its variants that are ordered by the court, and of course, probation, testing, in-patient medicaid fraud mills, you name it. Since none of these actually do anything except use homebrewed aversion therapy or even less efficient, shame, to achieve what is basically not even a real goal but is tied to the criminal justice system, congrats, you have the perfect storm of demand not knowing how much to actually demand for. Fentanyl being the adulterant made this last inevitable easier, but it only hastened what had been happening for quite some time. When heroin supply on streets increased, fentanyl related deaths began decreasing. Wonder why? It's correlative, but observational studies take a lot more data and a lot longer time periods, although it would certainly follow previously observed patterns.</p><p>This may be interesting as a scientific venture, but treating it as anything but that is foolhardy and misguided. We know how to control pain. We know how to reduce the harmful externalities that form part of the definition of substance use disorder since we, as in society and lawmakers elected by us, are responsible for those harmful externalities in the first place. Fentanyl is not the problem. Making sure that there's no safe way to reduce potential harm associated with, ultimately, a personal choice favored by some but certainly not all as recreation, killed the hundreds of thousands since Lou Reed sang Heroin and put it onto the Velvet Underground and Nico. Why are we still acting brand new?</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I’ve been to a few AA meetings when I was trying to get my mom sober and I never got the vibe that it was about “aversion therapy” for alcohol. The whole point seemed to be to discharge your egotistical need to be “in control” of the alcohol and accept that it was taking over your life despite your best efforts. You were then supposed to seek help from the people in the group to try to keep that from happening. There wasn’t really a culture of shame but rather acceptance there. And they also pushed a lot of ideas like repair after rupture that are a part of normal human relationships. So I don’t really buy what you’re saying here.</div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Over the last 10 years, state medical boards have dramatically cut back on opioid prescriptions (which happens to correlate with the rise of fentanyl use). Even those with chronic pain with a history of prescription were cut back. It's unfortunate because for some people, opioids really are the only thing that works for treating incurable pain but the downside is that they develop tolerances and they become ineffective over time. It really would be a miracle if we could invent a pain medication that is non-addictive.<p>However, a new type of pain medication doesn't remove the current opioids available on the street. Legalization of marijuana is one thing, it's relatively low risk but I don't see legalization of opioids ever happening because absolutely nothing can replace the warm blanket feeling that they provide.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Yeah, the idea is that you set up a repo for a project (the hive), and then once you have the hive, you can set up multiple combs (git clones, not workspaces) and work in parallel. Suppose you have like 3-5 issues / tickets you're working on - the idea is that you can do this in parallel, in isolated dirs, and jump between them in one place. I used to have to do this in tabs in zellij / sessions in tmux and remember which sessions is which issue / ticket. Also having to manually git clone everytime was annoying. So this is an abstraction to simplify this. Does that make sense?</div>"

There are no network effects for sure, but people have hundreds and thousands on conversation on these apps that can't be easily moved elsewhere.

One striking similarity is the inability to innovate themselves, instead relying on copying others or acquiring.<p>The OpenClaw guy is surely a decent product person, but OpenClaw did not innovate in any real sense. He was just pushing an existing idea to the limit without any concern for quality or security. It had its hype moment, it inspired a bunch of people, and might find its own niche, but it is a flavor of the week kind of thing. I've been getting a lot more cold-calls by non-technical people in the last few weeks thanks to it. Congratulations, the quality threshold that justifies my response rose in equal measure.

The second option is dead in the water with the advent of the Chinese models. I guess they can lobby to have them banned and create a cartel with their other US based competitors.

In fact this perception is so common that there is even a name for it in psychology: Third-person effect. Many people believe that advertising does not affect them. But ironically, the more you believe so, the more likely you are to fall victim to particular types of advertising. And in general your response to ads will be very similar to everyone else's. These \"annoying\" ads that you \"would never click on\" are just badly personalized or badly placed ads. That's the only type that gets stuck in your mind when you think of ads, based on your personal biases. But the major tech companies have spent the last one-and-a-half decades on perfecting the psychology of advertising. You might <i>think</i> you are immune, but you are certainly not. Every buying decision you have made in the last 10 years was almost certainly influenced to some degree. Just not always consciously.

The content creator is reimbursed for their output that is used to convince viewers to perform some purchase activity, usually over alternatives.</p><p>You’re really severely restricting the definition yourself by claiming an ad is “things that ublock origin” blocks. They can’t block physical banners and billboards or TV commercial breaks - does that now make them not ads? Whether you intended to buy something again doesn’t disqualify something from being an ad. In fact, that’s often when an ad is most effective - to buy the one they show you, instead of one you haven’t heard of or considered.</p></div>"

And I mean, super detailed user models - where you are from, what you do, what are your most vulnerable weaknesses, what you care about the most and everything else. This is information even the world's largest advertising company would struggle to put together across their fragmented eco-system (Gmail, Search, etc), but OpenAI has all this on a silver platter. And that scares me, because, a lot of people use ChatGPT as a therapist. We know this because of their advertising intent which they've explicitly expressed. Advertising requires good user models to work (so advertisers can efficiently target their audience) and it is the only way to prove ROI to the advertisers. \"But, OpenAI said they won't do targeted ads..\". Remember, Google said \"Don't be evil\" once upon a time too..<p>That's ok, we use ChatGPT only for coding. We should be good, right? Umm, no. They already explicitly expressed the intention to take a percentage of your revenue if you shipped something with ChatGPT, so even the tech guys aren't safe.</p><p>\"As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge.

I'd say AI assistants are no more sticky than browsers or search engines.</p><p>You might be tempted to say that Chrome or Google are sticky. But they're really not. A lot of people aren't old enough to remember the 90s when we had multiple search engines and people did switch. I know this goes against prevailing HN dogma but I'm sorry: Google is simply the best search engine. It doesn't have a magical hold on people. People aren't fooling themselves.</p><p>And Chrome? Before smartphones it was simply the better browser. Firefox used to have a much larger market share and Chrome ate their lunch. By being a better browser. Chrome was I think the first browser, or at least the first <i>major</i> browser, to do one process per tab. I still remember Firefox hanging my entire browser when something went wrong. I switched to Chrome in version 2 for that reason.</p><p>And now browsers are more sticky because of Chrome on Android and Safari on iOS. Safari really needs to be cross-platform, like seriously so. I know they briefly tried on Windows but they didn't really mean it.</p><p>Anyway, back to the point. I believe there's a certain amount of brand inertia but that's it. If Gemini dominates ChatGPT performance and UI/UX, people will switch so fast.</p><p>Google, Microsoft and Meta can survive the AI collapse. Apple is irrelevant (at least for now). OpenAI?

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Microsoft is surviving precisely because of stickiness as you put it. But their users have to use them, and have to pay for it. There are very few people that use openai today that have to pay for it, those forced to use it are typically doing so via free avenues like windows copilot.<p>OpenAI has the stickiness of MSN news or MS Teams. Your wife uses chatgpt on a daily basis but is she paying for it? If they charge her $0.99/mo will she not look at alternatives? If she gets two or three bad responses from chatgpt in a row, will she not explore alternatives to see if there is something better? Does she not use google? If she does, she is already interacting with gemini everyday via their AI overview.</p><p>OpenAI has a first-to-market advantage, not a moat as you think. they can absolutley dominate the market, if they stay on top of their game. Ebay was the main online shopping network, they had that advantage, they were even the ones that made Paypal a thing! But they're relatively little used now, better alternatives crushed them.</p><p>Amazon was the first-to-market with cloud services, they didn't get worse in any significant way, but their market share is not as great as it used to be, Azure has gained decent ground on them. 10 years ago the market share break down was 31/7/4, now it is 28/21/14 for AWS/Azure/GCP respectively.</p><p>For OpenAI to survive it needs most of the market share, if it gets only a 3rd for example, the AI industry on its own needs to be a $1T+ industry. Over the past 10 years revenue alone (not profit) for AWS has been $620B total and just made $128B in revenue (highest) last year. OpenAI needs to make in profits (not revenue) what AWS made last year in revenue by 2029 just to break even. If it manages to just break even by then, it needs to have more profits than the revenue AWS managed to attain after its entire lifetime until now. It's far easier to switch LLM models than cloud providers too!</p><p>Their only remote way of survival, I hate to say it, is by going the way of palantir and doing dirty things for governments and militaries. they need a cash-cow client that can't get anyone else like that. And even then, being US-based, I don't think outside the US any military is insane enough to use OpenAI at all due to geopolitics. Even in sectors like education, Google (via chromebooks) is more likely to form  dependence than Microsoft via OpenAI since somehow they're more open to arbitrary apps due to historical anti-trust suits.</p><p>I can see a somewhat far-fetched argument being made for their survival, but only on thin-threads and excellent execution. But I can't see how they can actually survive competition. They're using the Azure strategy for market share, they're banking on AI being so ubiquitous that existing vendor-lock-in mindset will serve as a moat. They'll need to be much more profitable than AWS in like 1/5th of the time. Their product is comparable to (and literally is in Azure) one of many cloud service offerings, as oppose to an entire cloud provider, and their costs are huge similar to cloud providers like needing their own data-centers level huge, they need to overcome those costs, and on top of that have $125B&gt; revenue in like 2 years!!</p></div>"

Once PCs could do most of what they could, nobody wanted a VAX anymore. I have a hard time imagining that all the big players today will survive that shift.

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I agree 100%. Often when I use increasingly powerful local models (qwen3.5:32b I love you) I mix in web search using search APIs from Brave, Perplexity, and DuckDuckGo summaries. Of course this requires that I use local models via small Python or Lisp scripts I write. I pay for the Lumo+ private chat service and it has excellent integrated search, like Gemini or ChatGPT.<p>EDIT: I have also experimented with creating a local search index for the common tech web sites I get information from - this is a pain in the ass to maintain, but offers very low latency to add search context for local model use. This is most useful with very small and fast local models so the whole experience is low latency.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Coding, via something like Claude or Codex, will likely always be something best done by hosted cloud models simply because the bar there can always be higher. But it's already entirely possible to run local models for chat and research and basic document creation that can compete perfectly fine with the cloud models from 6 months to a year ago. The limitation at this point is just the cost of RAM.<p>This week's released of the new smaller Qwen 3.5 models was interesting. I ran a 4-bit quant of the 122b model on my NVIDIA Spark, and it's... pretty damn smart.  The smaller models can be run at 8-bits on machines at very reasonable speeds. And they're not stupid. They're smarter than \"ChatGPT\" was a year or so ago.</p><p>AMD Strix Halo machines with 128GB of RAM can already be bought off the shelf for not-insane prices that can run these just fine. Same with M-series Macs.</p><p>Once the supply shocks make their way through the system I could see a scenario where it's possible that every consumer Mac or Windows install just comes with a 30B param or even higher model onboard that is smart enough for basic conversation and assistance, and is equipped with good tool use skills.</p><p>I just don't see a moat for OpenAI or Anthropic beyond specialized applications (like software development, CAD, etc). For long-tail consumer things?  I don't see it.</p></div>"

I think all that could fit in a local model at some point.<p>Especially if, for example, Amazon ever develops an AWS-specific model that only needs to know AWS tech and maybe even picks a single language to support, or maybe a different model for each language, etc. Maybe that could end up being tiny and super fast.</p><p>I mean, most of what we do is simple CRUD wrappers. Sometimes I think humans in the loop cause more problems than we solve, overindexing on clever abstractions that end up mismatching the next feature, painting ourselves into fragile designs they can't fix due to backward compatibility, using dozens of unnecessary AWS features just for the buzz, etc. Sometimes a single monolith with a few long functions with a million branches is really all you need.</p><p>Or, if there's ever a model architecture that allows some kind of plugin functionality (like LoRA but more composable; like Skills but better), that'd immediately take over. You get a generic coding skeleton LLM and add the plugins for whatever tech you have in your stack. I'm still holding out for that as the end game.</p></div>"

It would be wrong to try to assess the IQ of Japanese (who don't know English) by asking about properties of the original word that are not shared by the Japanese equivalent. On the other hand, English speakers won't ever experience haiku fully, since the script plays a big role in the composition (according to what I'm told... I don't know Japanese, but anime intake exposed me to opinions like this; and even if I'm dead wrong with details, it sounds like a plausible analogy, at least...)</div>"

No other AI player is as exposed. Their massive spending commitments are all precariously balanced on the other end by their user base, and if that evaporates, the whole thing will fall apart and that could crash the stocks of other players ...and by crash, I mean bring them down to a realistic value.

I like both services but only wanted to pay for one and I chose Lumo+ because chat history is stored with my Proton data and is available in all my devices, Duck.ai stores chat history on current access device. Both services are also very usable with their free plans.<p>At least some of us in HN talk about limiting the data we give to Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc. Isn’t it just as important to limit what we share with non-privacy preserving AIs?</p><p>Note: tech friends have asked me how I can use slightly weaker AI models and be happy about it: I still use Gemini Plus (and Anthropic via AntiGravity) for technical work: everything I do as a software developer is open source and all of my writing (20+ books) is Open Content so I don’t care about privacy and being direct-marketed based on my tech work. To me it makes sense to use the best AI just for tech work and a private AI for everything else. Think about this if a family member has a serious health problem, or something else private: do you want to use open web searches and open AI chats, or do you want to use private web search and private AI access? Why not make privacy your default, except in special situations?</p></div>"

The idea is that you start with barebones and add things that you need for your own goals.</p><p>claude-code HAS to have all these bells and whistles that pollute context to support larger audiences that can't tinker with it.

But a) I think the enterprise consumer is much less likely to trust a model creator not to stick its hand in the cookie jar than a middleman who needs the trust to survive, and b) the vertical competitors typically don’t use the absolute most up-to-date models in their products anyway, so why not just go open-source and run everything in-house? 6 months is a long time in tech, but it’s the blink of an eye in most white-collar professions.</div>"

The user-centric culture that Steve Jobs championed at Apple is quite orthogonal to the trajectory of artificial intelligence.  AI has been under collective development for decades.  Along this trajectory ChatGPT was the discovery of a viable \"product\".  Remembering OpenAI's documented history, ChatGPT was not the result of building a tool towards solving a specific user need.  It is no accident that Apple does not know what to do with AI yet.  I am hoping that they can learn from Anthropic's tool empowerment lead and from the possibilities of OpenClaw, and instrument thoughtful AI integrations for their products.  OpenAI can learn from them too, but they aren't in a particularly advantageous incumbent position like Apple and Google.  But whatever Apple may do, it will only be a fraction of the AI story, regardless of its consumer success.  Comparing the markets of OpenAI and Anthropic highlights this diversity.</div>"

It's now an oligopolistic market with extreme barriers to entry due to needed scale. The moat will keep growing as the payoffs from scale keep growing. They have internal scale and scope economies as the breadth of synthetic data expands. The small differences between the labs now are the initial conditions that will magnify the differences later.</p><p>It wouldn't be surprising to also see consolidation of the industry in the next 2 years which makes it even more difficult to compete, as 2 or 3 winners gobble up everyone and solidify their leads.</p><p>When people worry about frontier lab's moat, they point to open weights models, which is really a commentary that these models have zero cost to replicate (like all software). But I think the era of open weights competition cannot be sustained, it's a temporary phenomenon tied to the middle-ground scale we're in where labs can still do that affordably. The absolute end of this will be the end-game of nation state backed competition.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c5A\">This article is significantly better written than most anti-OpenAI/AI articles, and for that I am really grateful. I am generally an AI booster (lol), so I am happy to read well-considered thought pieces from people who disagree with me.<p>That being said...</p><p>&gt; The one place where OpenAI does have a clear lead today is in the user base: it has 8-900m users. The trouble is, there’re only ‘weekly active’ users: the vast majority even of people who already know what this is and know how to use it have not made it a daily habit. Only 5% of ChatGPT users are paying, and even US teens are much more likely to use this a few times a week or less than they are to use it multiple time a day.</p><p>This really props up the whole argument, because the author goes on to say that OpenAI's users are not really engaged. But is \"only\" 5% of users paying of a 8-900M user base really so inconsequential? What percentage of Meta's users are paying? Google's? I would be curious to see the author dig deeper here, because I am skeptical that this is really as bad as the author suggests.</p><p>Moving on to another section:</p><p>&gt; If the next step is those new experiences, who does that, and why would it be OpenAI? The entire tech industry is trying to invent the second step of generative AI experiences - how can you plan for it to be you? How do you compete with this chart - with every entrepreneur in Silicon Valley?</p><p>Er, are any of these startups training foundation models? No? Then maybe that is how you compete? I suppose the author would say that the foundation model isn't doing much for OpenAI's engagement metrics (and therefore revenue), but I am not sure I agree there.</p><p>Still, really good article. I think it really crystalizes the anti-OpenAI argument and it gives me a lot of interesting things to think about.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; What percentage of Meta's users are paying? Google's?<p>The advertiser based business model for those companies makes your question/thought process here problematic for me. Historically speaking Google and \"Meta\" (Facebook) were primarily <i>advertising provider</i> companies. They provided billboards (space and time on the web page in front of an end-user) to people who were willing to buy tht space and time on the billboard. The \"free access\" end-users would always end up seeing said billboards, which is how they ended up \"paying\" for the service.</p><p>So most of Meta/Google end-users were \"paying\" users. They were being subsidised by the advertising customers paying for the end-users (who were forced to view adverts). The end-users paid with interruption to the service by an advert. [0]</p><p>In that context it feels a little like you're comparing apples to dave's left foot, as OpenAI hasn't had that with advertising ............ historically [1].</p><p>--</p><p>[0]: yes ad-blockers, yes more diverse revenue income streams over the years like with phones, yes this is simplified yadayada</p><p>[1]: excluding government etc. ~bailouts~ investments as not the same as advertising subsidies, but you could argue it's doing the same thing</p></div>"

OpenAI has to spend massively per free user it serves. The others you mentioned have SaaS economics where the marginal cost of onboarding and serving each non-paying user is essentially zero while also gaining money from these free users via advertising. Hence, the free users are actually a net positive rather than an endless money sink.</p><p>Keep also in mind that AI has always been, and will always be, a commodity.

Fun for vacation but a recipe to waste time and money setting up a local corporate entity and a whole team when I can just pay GCP or AWS and have a server on the other side of the planet from me faster than I can book a plane flight and hotel reservation there.<p>There's also the maintenance of the server to be considered. Vercel or other PaaS/Lambda/GCP functions/etc serverless means there's just less crap for me to manage, because they're dealing with it, and yeah, they charge money for that service. Being able to tell Claude code, I setup ssh keys and sudo no password for you, go fix my shit; like, that works, but then the hard drive is full so I have to up size the VPS, and if you're stupid/brave, you can give Claude Code MCP access to Chrome so it can click the buttons in Hetzner to upsize for you, but that's time and tokens spent not working on the product so at the end of the day I think Vercel is gonna be fine. AI generating code means there are many many more people trying out making some sort of Internet company, but they'll only discover cheaper options only after paying for Vercel becomes painful.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">This comment confuses me. You call Jobs idiosyncratic, but then try to backwards-justify his political stance with stereotypes about anti-establishment politics and Californian ideals. What makes you convinced that he'd resist neoreactionary politicking any better than Cook?<p>Jobs <i>was</i> fickle, I agree with you there. I just don't think that a fickle iconoclast would last more than two weeks fighting against Trump, especially if he was threatened with an FTC antitrust probe. The only difference with Cook is that he's not as coy, and recognized that there was no way for a monopoly like Apple to fight the fed and win. Trump can disembowel Apple's profit margins, and neither Cook nor Jobs nor Jesus of Nazarath could convince the shareholders that morality is worth more than $AAPL. 2016 Jobs would be retired by the board of directors before he even threatened to make a conscientious objection, reality distortion be damned.</p><p>I have no love for the sitting administration, but it is a fantasy to pretend that a FAANG business could resist federal coercion. Just because Apple enjoys a moral halo-effect does not mean they're better positioned than Microsoft or AWS to do the \"right\" thing. Apple's inability to prosecute NSO Group is a recurring example of how heavily the US can muzzle them.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">There is some important context missing from the article.<p>First, MCP tools are sent on every request. If you look at the notion MCP the search tool description is basically a mini tutorial. This is going right into the context window. Given that in most cases MCP tool loading is all or nothing (unless you pre-select the tools by some other means) MCP in general will bloat your context significantly. I think I counted about 20 tools in GitHub Copilot VSCode extension recently. That's a lot!</p><p>Second, MCP tools are not compossible. When I call the notion search tool I get a dump of whatever they decide to return which might be a lot. The model has no means to decide how much data to process. You normally get a JSON data dump with many token-unfriendly data-points like identifiers, urls, etc. The CLI-based approach on the other hand is scriptable. Coding assistant will typically pipe the tool in jq or tail to process the data chunk by chunk because this is how they are trained these days.</p><p>If you want to use MCP in your agent, you need to bring in the MCP model and all of its baggage which is a lot. You need to handle oauth, handle tool loading and selection, reloading, etc.</p><p>The simpler solution is to have a single MCP server handling all of the things at system level and then have a tiny CLI that can call into the tools.</p><p>In the case of mcpshim (which I posted in another comment) the CLI communicates with the sever via a very simple unix socket using simple json. In fact, it is so simple that you can create a bash client in 5 lines of code.</p><p>This method is practically universal because most AI agents these days know how to use SKILLs. So the goal is to have more CLI tools. But instead of writing CLI for every service you can simply pivot on top of their existing MCP.</p><p>This solves the context problem in a very elegant way in my opinion.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">The point of the MCP is for the upstream provider to provider agent specific tools and to handle authentication and session management.<p>Consider the Google Meet API. To get an actual transcript from Google Meet you need to perform 3-4 other calls before the actual transcript is retrieved. That is not only inefficient but also the agent will likely get it wrong at least once. If you have a dedicated MCP then Google in theory will provide a single transcript retrieval tool which simplifies the process.</p><p>The authentication story should not be underestimated either. For better or worse, MCP allows you to dynamically register oauth client through a self registration process. This means that you don't need to register your own client with every single provider. This simplifies oauth significantly. Not everyone supports it because in my opinion it is a security problem but many do.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; Yeah this is just straight up nonsense.<p>I was just sharing my experience I'm not sure what you mean. Just n=1 data point.</p><p>From first principles I 100% agree and yes I was using a CLI tool I made with typer that has super clear --help + had documentation that was supposed to guide multi step workflows. I just got much better performance when I tried MCP. I asked Claude Code to explain the diff:</p><p>&gt; why does our MCP onbaroding get better performance than the using objapi in order to make these pipelines? Like I can see the\n  performance is better but it doesn't intuitively make sense to me why an mcp does better than an API for the \"create a pipeline\" workflow</p><p>It's not MCP-the-protocol vs API-the-protocol. They hit the same backend. The difference is who the interface was designed for.</p><p></p><pre><code>  The CLI is a human interface that Claude happens to use. Every objapi pb call means:\n  - Spawning a new Python process (imports, config load, HTTP setup)\n  - Constructing a shell command string (escaping SQL in shell args is brutal)\n  - Parsing Rich-formatted table output back into structured data\n  - Running 5-10 separate commands to piece together the current state (conn list, sync list, schema classes, etc.)\n\n  The MCP server is an LLM interface by design. The wins are specific:\n\n  1. onboard://workspace-state resource — one call gives Claude the full picture: connections, syncs, object classes, relations, what exists, what's missing. With the CLI, Claude\n  runs a half-dozen commands and mentally joins the output.\n  2. Bundled operations — explore_connection returns tables AND their columns, PKs, FKs in one response. The CLI equivalent is conn tables → pick table → conn preview for each. Fewer\n   round-trips = fewer places for the LLM to lose the thread.\n  3. Structured in, structured out — MCP tools take JSON params, return JSON. No shell escaping, no parsing human-formatted tables. When Claude needs to pass a SQL string with quotes\n   and newlines through objapi pb node add sql --sql \"...\", things break in creative ways.\n  4. Tool descriptions as documentation — the MCP tool descriptions are written to teach an LLM the workflow. The CLI --help is written for humans who already know the concepts.\n  5. Persistent connection — the MCP server keeps one ObjectsClient alive across all calls. The CLI boots a new Python process per command.\n\n  So the answer is: same API underneath, but the MCP server eliminates the shell-string-parsing impedance mismatch and gives Claude the right abstractions (fewer, chunkier operations\n   with full context) instead of making it pretend to be a human at a terminal.\n\n</code></pre>\nFor context I was working on a visual data pipeline builder and was giving it the same API that is used in the frontend - it was doing very poorly with the API.</div>"

A good gateway exposes a tiny minimal context with just instructions how to query what is available and has a configurable \"eager\" flag for the things that should be put eagerly into the context for certain agent profiles.\nSecondly many many mcp servers are outdated as they were build for way dumber models than what we have today and will have overly heavy context and descriptions that slow down and degrade the current frontier models.

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I started adding cli's for a few things last week. Initially just for myself but it didn't take me long to figure out that codex / claude code / etc. are pretty good at figuring out cli's as well. And creating them. If you have APIs, generating a usable cli for them is pretty straightforward. With lots of nice features, documentation, bash/zsh autocomplete support and other bells and whistles. Doing that manually is a lot of repetitive work. Having that stuff generated on the other hand doesn't have to take a lot of time.<p>The combination with skills is where it really shines. And you can generate those as well for your shiny new cli. Once you have that in place, you can drive your API agentically to do non trivial things in it.</p><p>One of my OSS projects, jillesvangurp/ktsearch now has such a cli. Ktsearch is a kotlin multiplatform library for Elasticsearch and Opensearch. The new cli compiles to jvm and native linux/mac binaries. I've been playing with this for the last week and adding a few features. It's very nice to have around if you deal with opensearch/elasticsearch clusters. No more messy curl commands and json blobs.</p><p>And I've gotten codex to use it for me for a few things already.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I'm looking at this from a slightly different level of abstraction.<p>The CLI approach definitely has practical benefits for token reduction. Not stuffing the entire schema into the runtime context is a clear win. But my main interest lies less in \"token cost\" and more in \"how we structure the semantic space.\"</p><p>MCP is fundamentally a tool-level protocol. Existing paradigms like Skills already mitigate context bloat and selection overhead pretty well via tool discovery and progressive disclosure. So framing this purely as \"MCP vs CLI\" feels more like shifting the execution surface rather than a fundamental architectural shift.</p><p>The direction I'm exploring is a bit different. Instead of treating tools as the primary unit, what if we normalize the semantic primitives <i>above</i> them (e.g., \"search,\" \"read,\" \"create\")? Services would then just provide a projection of those semantics. This lets you compress the semantic space itself, expose it lazily, and only pull in the concrete tool/CLI/MCP adapters right at execution time.</p><p>You can arguably approximate this with Skills, but the current mental model is still heavily anchored to \"tool descriptions\"—it doesn't treat normalized semantics as first-class citizens. So while the CLI approach is an interesting optimization, I'm still on the fence about whether it's a real structural paradigm shift beyond just saving tokens.</p><p>Ultimately, shouldn't the core question be less about \"how do we expose fewer tools,\" and more about \"how do we layer and compress the semantic space the agent has to navigate?\"</p></div>"

And you get composability for free - pipe to jq, grep, head, whatever.</p><p>The auth story is where MCP still wins though.

CLI tools assume you already have credentials configured locally, which is fine for developer tooling but doesn't work for consumer-facing AI products.</p><p>For developer workflows specifically, I think the sweet spot is what some people are calling SKILL files - a markdown doc that tells the agent what CLI tools are available and when to use them.

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">So much incorrect and misinformation in these comments. As someone who is building an agent[0] with MCP tools, neither the MCP tool description nor the response is the problem. Both of those are easily solved by not bloating them.<p>The real killer is the input tokens on each step. If you have 100k tokens in the conversation, and the LLM calls an MCP tool, the output <i>and the existing</i> conversation is sent back. So now you've input 200k tokens to the LLM.</p><p>Now imagine 10 tool calls per user message - or 50. You're sending 1-5M input tokens, not because the MCP definitions or tool responses are large, but because at each step, you have to send the whole conversation again.</p><p>\"what about caching\" - Only 90% savings, also cache misses are surprisingly common (we see as low as 40% cache hit rate)</p><p>\"MCP definitions are still large\" - not compared to any normal conversation. Also these get cached</p><p>We've seen the biggest savings by batching/parallelizing tool calls. I suspect the future of LLM tool usage will have a different architecture, but CLI doesn't solve the problems either.</p><p>[0] <a href=\"https://ziva.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ziva.sh</a>, it's an agent specialized for Godot[1]</p><p>[1] <a href=\"https://godotengine.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://godotengine.org</a></p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I've seen folks say that the future of using computers will be with an LLM that generates code on the fly to accomplish tasks. I think this is a bit ridiculous, but I do think that operating computers through natural language instructions is superior for a lot of cases and that seems to be where we are headed.<p>I can see a future where software is built with a CLI interface underneath the (optional) GUI, letting an LLM hook directly into the underlying \"business\" logic to drive the application. Since LLM's are basically text machines, we just need somebody to invent a text-driven interface for them to use...oh wait!</p><p>Imagine booking a flight - the LLM connects to whatever booking software, pulls a list of commands, issues commands to the software, and then displays the output to the user in some fashion. It's basically just one big language translation task, something an LLM is best at, but you still have the guardrails of the CLI tool itself instead of having the LLM generate arbitrary code.</p><p>Another benefit is that the CLI output is introspectable. You can trace everything the LLM is doing if you want, as well as validate its commands if necessary (I want to check before it uses my credit card). You don't get this if it's generating a python script to hit some API.</p><p>Even before LLM's developers have been writing GUI applications as basically a CLI + GUI for testability, separation of concerns etc. Hopefully that will become more common.</p><p>Also this article was obviously AI generated. I'm not going to share my feelings about that.</p></div>"

I would definitely call him a high master of stencil technique though, some of that stuff is pretty hard to pull off.<p>As clever as his art is, I think he's still very much an outsider in the capital-W Art World, which for his part he's often trying to prank.  (Which they richly deserve, see Exit Through the Gift Shop.)</p><p>Things like the self-destroying painting were high-concept but also completely staged. For another artist getting rich off his contempt for the Art Market, but solidly on the Art World side of the fence, see Maurizio Cattelan.</p><p>One person with a foot in both worlds is Alex Face but he's mostly known in South-East Asia.

My theory is that the system in Europe allows people to nurture their creative side, meanwhile in North America it's a hyper-capitalistic system and society where you are always running away from some beast -if not debt, it is rent, if not taxes, it's something else- making people run like hamsters on wheels with zero space for disconnection and solitude. And if you managed to make something cool, suddenly you are pressured to grow and expand and look for investors and whatnot. Even job-wise, in the US for example, there's this hustle culture where you are somewhat expected to keep grinding after work, and if you don't, you are either seen as less productive, a slacker, or even terminated for performance issues. If you decide to quit, you might end up homeless, so you are in this never-ending cycle where your life is about grinding and being busy with what's considered \"productive\".<p>Not to dismiss the rest of the world, but my focus was on the western side, not so sure how it goes in other parts of the world.</p></div>"

We are seeing that play out now not through some sci-fi uprising, but through the quiet erosion of accountability. When we let an algorithm decide who gets a loan or who is targeted in a conflict, we are not just using a tool.

Fact has already caught up.<p>The IDF used tools like Lavender and \"Is Daddy Home\" to analyze communications, identify members of Hamas, and learn when they were home so they could be killed with bomb strikes.</p><p>This has long been possible for humans to do, but it's a laborious process.  In the past, only people high up in chains of command received such bespoke treatment.  AI tools permitted the IDF to grant the same treatment to raw recruits who had been given the sum total of a pep-talk and a pistol.</p><p>The result was widespread destruction and indiscriminate killing of civilians.  The IDF didn't spend much time scrutinizing AI recommendations and were willing to act on false positives.  Every bomb strike, by design (i.e. \"Is Daddy home\"'s purpose was to determine when targets were in their family homes), took out civilians.  Just taking a pizza order from a Hamas member years before the war might have been enough to get entire families <i>and their neighbours</i> killed.</p><p>If humans hate another group of humans enough and an AI says \"Kill\", they'll kill.  Without thought or remorse.  We don't merely need to be worried about murderous robots on battlefields, we also need to worry about humans implementing the recommendations of AI without thinking for themselves.</p></div>"

If Pete Hegseth forces Dario Amodei to fold, not one but two monstrous precedents will be set.</p><p>The first is obvious, and terrible in itself. The second is subtle but no less important.</p><p>The first is that what Secretary Hegseth is demanding, backed by heavy threats, is that the US military have full, unrestricted access to Anthropic’s AI software, for applications such as military surveillance and autonomous weapons without humans in the loop. This could well extend to nuclear weapons.1</p><p>Nothing that I have read convinces me that Secretary Hegseth has a nuanced understanding of the strengths and limits of current AI, or that he will show restraint in how he applies it. Rather he is trying to define his career in part around deploying AI as broadly and as quickly as possible.</p><p>The second is that Hegseth’s maneuver is an audacious power grabs that aims to circumvent Congress. By setting a deadline of 5:01 PM eastern tomorrow, Hegseth aims to cut everybody else – even Congress — out of the loop.</p><p>A reader of this newsletter, a tech writer who describes himself as a political independent just wrote to me, rightfully panicked:</p><p>Today the Pentagon will force Anthropic to change their corporate goal of responsible AI. This is not something to be decided in the marketplace by a bully with deep pockets; it must be decided in Congress. Senators and Congressmen must take a position and deliberate in public about whether it is OK to use AI for surveillance of Americans and to launch lethal strikes controlled by AI with no “human in the loop”. Please say something today, before Amodei has to surrender.</p><p>He is right.</p><p>Please call or write your Senators and Representatives right now.</p><p>§</p><p>AI policy, especially of this magnitude, is something that American people should have a say in. Congress should deliberate. Mass surveillance and AI-fueled weapons, possibly nuclear, without humans in the loop are categorically not things that one individual, even one in the Cabinet, should be allowed to decide at a gunpoint.</p><p>But that is exactly where we are headed.</p><p>1\nHegsseth’s demand would in principle extend to apply Anthropic’s software to nuclear weapons without humans in the loop. In that connection, people should probably be aware of the fact that S. 1394 - Block Nuclear Launch by Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Act of 2023 failed to pass. Which means we might not have a Stanislav Petrov next time around.</p><p>Discussion about this post\nWrite a comment...\nRichard Self\n7h</p><p>Given the unreliability of GenAI in everything that it do, the use in unsupervised warfare will be catastrophic.</p><p>Reply\nShare\n1 reply\nRoman's Attic\n7h</p><p>From what I’ve heard, these calls are especially valuable if you emphasize that this is an issue that will determine how you vote in the future</p><p>Reply\nShare\n1 reply\n58 more comments...</p><p>No posts</p><p>Ready for more?\nType your email...\nSubscribe\n© 2026 Gary Marcus · Privacy ∙ Terms ∙ Collection notice\nStart your Substack\nGet the app\nSubstack is the home for great culture\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">This is a prescient warning about yet another abuse of power by the Trump administration that we would all do well to heed, so I'm sure it will be flagged to death within an hour or two.  Many people here like to consider themselves \"above politics\" and \"apolitical\", thinking that if they just ignore all noise they can just keep living their lives as if this is all normal.  But it is not normal.  I think the priority of the \"Secretary of War\" Pete Hegseth here is likely political surveillance and suppression at home, not autonomous nuclear weapons, but he is a known alcoholic who has repeatedly shown terrible judgement so I can't really rule anything out.<p>This administration is criminal and has repeatedly shown disdain for the fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution.  Our democratic system is only as strong as the will of the people to protect it.</p><p>The call to action at the end of the article is good.  I think it's worth calling your senators and house reps to speak up about this.  Politicians in general are slimy and spineless, those seem to be traits required to succeed in politics, but as a consequence they do tend to notice when people really speak up and care about issues.   As a survival instinct if nothing else.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">I'm a big fan of Postgres\nI've used it for a while and prefer it (partly due to experience) over other options.\nThere is a lot that it _can_ do, especially when you take FDW, extensions, PLs, etc into the equation.<p>However, it's not an \"always better\" situation. These other specialized services excel in ways that Postgres cannot at the moment. _If_ you have a small system, _and_ the featureset you need overlaps with postgres' abilities, _and_ you don't expect to outgrow those two properties, then it could definitely make sense to use Postgres.</p><p>Let's imagine that adding all the pressure to the same system _didn't_ impact other parts of the same system (you wouldn't want a surge in kafka write traffic causing latency on your basic crud routes, right?).</p><p>Redis vs Postgres unlogged tables:</p><p>* Redis has a bunch of algorithms which are battle-tested and ease implementation of common patterns. Need a bloom filter, expiration with ttl that you don't need to write extra code for?</p><p>Kafka/SQS vs postgres queueing:\n* There are pros and cons here, but you definitely don't want your other Postgres work being impeded by high spikes in traffic. Distributed logs and dedicated message queues are built to handle elastic scalability in ways that are difficult to achieve with Postgres. What if you have certain, super busy tenants whose queueing traffic comes in giant batches at unexpected times? With SQS and their recent fair queues, you not only don't need to worry about the spikes (as long as your writers can write fast enough), but you also don't need to worry about the distribution of in-flight consumer work being imbalanced due to the spikiness of a single tenant</p><p>ElasticSearch:\n* Postgres FTS can work for a number of simple scenarios, but there's a number of edge-cases where performance deteriorates as well. What happens when large documents are normal? <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/1q5ts8u/postgres_with_large_jsonbs_vs_elasticsearch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://old.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/1q5ts8u/postgre...</a> shows some metrics on what happens when you get into TOAST territory. FTS also puts a decent load on the db both in indexing as well as searching.</p><p>MongoDB:\n* Mongo, for all of the deficiencies that it's had over the years (which I hear are mostly resolved these days), can scale writes in a _muuuuch_ more simple way than Postgres.</p><p>The claim is that \"unless you're at unbelievable scale\" you won't hit it, however I don't think that's true.\nI've worked on multiple Postgres databases that tapped out due to the amount of work it would take to scale things up further (full tenant sharding by db, multiple shards for some larger tenants, keeping that all going and working at a larger scale).</p><p>Every additional piece of logic you add into Postgres complicates the story of how you fix things once it becomes too much. Once you've got a single write that triggers 10 different table writes, with 80 index updates, and you want to scale those writes up, you might hit scenarios where you need to choose what gets migrated out. Or you get smart with materialized views, but those require full refreshes. So you create your own version of incrementally-maintained-views, which is more writes and work.</p><p>That all being said, I do think Postgres can work for more concerns than it currently is used for, even if I think the recent glazing is a bit much.</p><p>Postgres is great, and having everything in a single transactional workload is extremely convenient and can remove a lot of race conditions and buggy behavior.</p></div>"

You’re making it happen without the head start that Richy Rich got the second he was born. Be proud of that! Knowing that the game is rigged is liberating!

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Nice article for engineers to understand something that most guitar players will intuitively know.<p>One of the great things about a hi-gain setup like Hendrix's is how the feedback loop will inject an element of controlled chaos into the sound. It allows for emergent fluctuations in timbre that Hendrix can wrangle, but never fully control. It's the squealing, chaotic element in something like his 'Star Spangled Banner'. It's a positive feedback loop that can run away from the player and create all kinds of unexpected elements.</p><p>The art of Hendrix's playing, then, is partly in how he harnessed that sound and integrated it into his voice. And of course, he's a force of nature when he does so.</p><p>A great place to hear artful feedback would be the intro to Prince's 'Computer Blue'. It's the squealing \"birdsong\" at the beginning and ending of the record. You can hear it particularly well if you search for 'Computer Blue - Hallway Speech Version' with the extended intro.</p></div>"

And the sound coming from the amp will do this shaking, completing the feedback loop. So it's mostly portable stringed instruments that get this treatment. There are some violin players that play with feedback effects. I hear Jon Rose is one but I am not familiar with his music. Folks like Jean Luc Ponty and Jerry Goodman make ample use of guitar pedal effects in their violin. And there's a YouTuber out there who plays with them on her harp.</div>"

Jimi was completely self taught, while Miles went to Juliard, I don't see how they would have communicated musically, literally. Like, if Miles tells Jimi to try a diminished chord here, or some modal scale there, Miles would have ended up doing a LOT of teaching along the way. And I say this as a guitarist of 30+ years who loves both of them.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Part of what makes Hendrix's live performances so great is how completely unreproducible they are. Even Jimi himself could never recreate that one note sustain when he begins the solo on Machine Gun. To re-create it, you'd have to set the room up exactly the same, tune the guitar exactly the same, position the guitar relative to amps exactly the same, etc. So Hendrix being very sensitive and connected to the room was able to harness that energy into something unique that stands the test of time. Machine Gun is well known, but his Red House performance at Randall's Island also stands out to me as exceptional, those are the 2 key Hendrix performances. I read somewhere that Miles Davis was really impressed by Machine Gun and you can see why.<p>One thing I learned after buying some gear at home to try to record electric guitar at low volume is how important the physics of the speakers are. You can plug a tube amp into a cabinet simulator and you'll lose a lot more than using solid state electronics on a good but not great Fender amp, especially if you use fuzz / distortion pedals.</p><p>I'm not sure Hendrix was a systems engineer, but he was a transcendent blues artist, that's for sure.</p></div>"

I love techno, but anyone who has learned other styles of music recognizes the repetitiveness and quirks of a lot of techno and some other electronic genres.<p>They do a great job with changing their timbre and tones but often ignore a bunch of other factors that make music interesting.   Whether that is the rarity of time signatures other than 4/4, the way certain rhythms are locked into certain genres, the choices of keys used, the limited or missing chords, etc.. at some point you start hearing two electronic songs that sound totally different at a superficial level and you realize they're incredibly derivative of each other.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">&gt; There are always some people who get extremely defensive whenever I say that techno didn't click for me until I heard this kind of \"techlow\" music. Specifically about the part where I think that the reason is also a human expression problem, because of limitations imposed by the electronic media used.<p>I guess the part people don't like hearing is the implication techno is somehow not expressive.  I'm not sure that it lacks expressiveness, but it is certainly more \"controlled\" than traditional music.  When I first heard techno as a teenager in the 90s, my mind was blown.  I remember exactly where I was the first time I heard Underworld [1], Photek [2], and Autechre [3].  I think I was attracted to these sounds _because_ they were so different.  I think it's hard for electronic music fans like myself to accept the idea that it isn't expressive _because_ it is so different. Isn't it just a different kind of expression?</p><p>Still, people like what they like.  I'm glad you found a version of dance music that works for you.  I've long since moved on being judgmental about people's musical tastes.  I think it's just wonderful that music exists at all!</p><p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5GjVvlmg3o\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5GjVvlmg3o</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xl1xzSRaV0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xl1xzSRaV0</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6zT3kVtpHc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6zT3kVtpHc</a></p></div>"

That doesn't mean it's not expressive, it's just expressive in a way that I struggle to connect with.</p><p>EDIT: funny enough I actually have protanomaly, so my choice of analogy is slightly ironic there. Some visual art and design out there objectively looks terrible from my subjective experience, since the colors look completely off.

Expression on guitar is pretty intuitive, but modern electronic instrument manufacturers have been working on this problem and created modes of expression that definitely solve this problem.</p><p>For example, EWIs allow you to use breath control for expression with many of the same techniques available on actual wind instruments. Also many synths now have features like polyphonic aftertouch, pitch/mod wheels, which allow you to add expression to a note while it is playing. Apps and hardware exist which allow you to use novel methods of capturing motion or other forms of expression. And most modern synths/midi controllers allow you to decide what parameters are affected.</p><p>&gt; Then on top of all that it is so incredibly physical</p><p>That's an affectation. I can stand on my tiptoes and close my eyes when bending up a note on the synth the same as I can on the guitar. Neither affects the sound, and both are a conscious decision to project an appearance of \"I'm really shredding\"</p><p>&gt; With an electric guitar you get the physicality and dynamism of an acoustic instrument with the complex timbres and extended technique possibilities of an electric/electronic instrument.</p><p>That can apply to any instrument once you \"electrify\" it.

Like, if your pedal should react to that impedance just buffer the front, put a big inductor (or a transformer using only half, or, - and I've actually seen this - just a whole guitar pickup) in the pedal.

The Fuzz Face has minimal input filtering, the guitar's knobs actually change the bias of the first transistor IIRC and cause massive changes in sound.</p><p>If you stick a buffer in front of it that interaction is gone and there is nothing you can stick after the buffer to bring it back.  You pretty much have to plug the guitar directly into a Fuzz Face for it to work as intended.   There are even constant arguments about putting the Wah in front of the FF or after it.   I'm not sure if the article even has it right or whether Hendrix did it differently at different times.   Other articles show a different order of the effects.</p><p>There are other fuzz circuits that behave differently and work better with buffers and would be more uniform when used with other types of instruments or with electric guitars with active pickups (which are buffered).</p><p>E.x. I have a Tone Bender and have had several Fuzzes in the \"Big Muff\" category along with one that was based on the Fox Tone Machine.    The Tone Bender and Big Muff can't clean up at all like the Fuzz Face via the guitar controls, and IIRC the Fox Tone Machine is somewhere in the middle.    The Fuzz Face when setup correctly is really quite amazing as you can go crystal clear to crushing fuzz with your volume knob on the guitar.  When you've tried it you realize Jimi Hendrix was doing it constantly in an amazing way.</p></div>"

Guitar is one of those hobbies where people mythologize and build elaborate hagiographies around players they like and the gear that they used. Hendrix was a generational talent but I highly doubt he was sitting around enumerating problem statements and systematically exploring solution spaces. The Fuzz Face was one of like four dirtboxes available during that time so he chose that one. He flipped a guitar upside down because he could source one more easily than a lefty model. He leveraged feedback because he discovered it naturally and realized that he could make it sound totally badass.</p><p>The man clearly had a vision and executed it but his decisions were pragmatic, not the product of grand technical reasoning. It reminds me of the student who wrote a bunch of authors and asked to what degree they were conscious of the themes and symbolism in their work [1].

(I'm not sure why he didn't play a lefty guitar upside if that was the case, but I could imagine that the availability might be relevant like you mentioned, or maybe his father was familiar enough with guitars to be able to recognize a left-handed one and figure out what was going on, or maybe because he was better left-handed he could play it upside-down well enough but due to not being right-handed he would have found it more difficult to play it in the non-standard way).</p></div>"

And yet his stuff feels like a creative dead end, a dreary road leading to adult contemporary. While Hendrix has no songs to speak of and only one sloppy screechy sound, but it's the sound that launches a thousand bands and feels inspiring even now. Maybe the lesson we're supposed to learn is that we shouldn't choose what goal to chase, we should just feel it.</div>"

The tremolo sound from the intro? That was four Fender Twin Reverbs. Myself controlling the speed of two of them and the producer controlling the speed of the other two.

Also we would go out with each other's amps, so we had to keep looking up at each other after every fifteen second bursts and kind of fess up, \"Oh yeah, mine kind of went out of time.\" It took long time, but I'm glad we did it that way because if we had cut and pasted two seconds of audio, it wouldn't have had the same dynamic quality throughout the six minutes of the song, or however long it is.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://www.westword.com/music/johnny-marr-on-how-he-created-the-sound-for-how-soon-is-now-without-effects-pedals-5704969/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.westword.com/music/johnny-marr-on-how-he-created...</a></p></div>"

This could be surprisingly unwanted: an agent which knows you better than you can know yourself has you forever on the back foot.  A human-like intelligence would follow contextual norms in dialog, and carry out its own agenda socially in a collaborative way. This also could be unwanted if the agent has super powers. But these observations are mere conjectures. Actual AI must be constantly cajoled within very narrow bounds by the intelligence of actual humans or its \"thinking\" turns to mush.<p>Does AI ever display creativity in any sense other than behaviors that follow a statistical spread around the training space?</p><p>If it can, why doesn't this make the news? These pseudo-aphoristic stories of how to cajole AIs are told 100 times a day!</p><p>To those uninitiated to computing, it might seem amazing given that a machine can do combinatorials at rates many orders of magnitude faster than a human, but the measure of creativity is with insights, hitherto unknown, that simplify the complex and bring the inexplicable within the range of intelligibility.</p><p>The cycle is AI is found to be ludicrously bad by some ordinary or trivial measure that demonstrates nothing like human thinking is occurring in the machine, then the news of it is published and the mechanical turk gets the message, then suddenly the AI \"knows\" what it can't figure out on its own.</p><p>The intelligence is an externality of humans enslaved to the care and feeding of data to it.</p><p>The machine is basically a storage system with a semantic mode for retrieval. And as its access mode is semantic, it looks like it's thinking, when there is no innate reasoning in the sense of human reasoning.</p><p>Build a house of mirrors and you will find you can get lost in it, but don't confuse a house that reflects your own mind with one that has a mind of its own.</p><p>A great danger resides with a system that can confuse people into believing it thinks operating at a world-wide scale.</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">To comment on the actual game (tested on Firefox desktop):<p>- The yellow box with hints overflows (and is cut off) in the middle of the second paragraph</p><p>- The site layout appears to be optimized for mobile (portrait) screens. But the actual interactive elements look to small for touch targets. For desktops (if that is a target), consider using the horizontal space more (e.g., for the box with hints or the leaderboard(s))</p><p>- The tooltips on the actions at the top of the lines games board were not in English (appear to be maybe Spanish/Portuguese). Seems like a missing translation (my language preferences are en;de).</p><p>- the lines game itself was fine, the idea is okay but I don't think I want to play more than 2-3 rounds of it (which is okay for a daily challenge-ish game). An improvement might be to highlight (with a light background on the board) what combinations of piece layouts are possible after placing the first block (e.g., the straight piece only has 4 possible layouts after the first block and one after the second).</p></div>"

The copy was a bit too long for certain browser/font configurations. I'm shortening the text so it fits perfectly without breaking the layout.</p><p>Layout/Targets: Spot on. The game was built strictly as for mobile to be played with one hand. Playing it on a big monitor right now is probably a bit of a torture! ;)</p><p>Tooltips: Nice catch! I had hardcoded the title attributes in Spanish and completely forgot to pass them through the translation dictionary. Fixed and deployed!</p><p>Highlighting piece projections: This is actually a really nice UX idea! I originally left it out because part of the core challenge is forcing the player to mentally visualize the rotations and placements, but I completely see how it would reduce the cognitive load.</p><p>Really appreciate the honest review!</p></div>"

It's particularly painful since they all replace the current piece, so they seem tailor-made to get rid of a nasty piece that would cause you to lose... but then they have to be used before you get to that piece that would cause you to lose!</p><p>Anyway, both times I played I got in the 40s without any power-ups used, then saw that the next piece would cause me to lose but none of the powers could save me. Probably the ideal fix is just to not trigger a loss while you still have powers?</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">Thanks for the suggestions!<p>Regarding the swipe-to-draw mechanic, I really believe that drawing the piece cell-by-cell on the board has a few intentional advantages:</p><p>1. It gives the player a sense of absolute control over the game and their placements.</p><p>2. It provides a sequence of 'micro-pleasures' or tactile feedback with each tap. It acts as a series of tiny micro-goals you achieve as you slowly build the piece.</p><p>3. It intentionally slows down the gameplay. Since this is a strategy puzzle, slowing the pace down is ideal because thinking mid-to-long term is absolutely crucial.</p><p>As for tapping the red piece to pre-rotate it... well, that’s exactly where the added difficulty lies! It’s a specific mental challenge that few games force you into. You have to make that little extra cognitive effort to visualize the piece on the board. I like to think it definitely helps improve your spatial awareness over time! ;)</p></div>"

          "<div class=\"commtext c00\">It's neither purely random 7 nor like drawing from a bag. It's a little bit more complex.<p>If I were to explain it the technical way:\nI use a custom Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) seeded by the current date (YYYYMMDD) to ensure deterministic gameplay—everyone gets the exact same piece sequence every day. I don't use flat probabilities; instead, I run the LCG output through a weighted roulette that changes based on the day of the week (e.g., higher probability for 'I' pieces on Mondays, higher for 'S' and 'Z' pieces on Sundays). Lastly, there's a system to mitigate consecutive identical pieces.</p><p>In simpler terms:\nI use a formula based on the current date to generate a different sequence of pieces every day, guaranteeing it's exactly the same for all users on that specific day. Then, I adjust this sequence using a probability matrix so that on Mondays you get more of the easy pieces (like the line or square), and on Sundays you get more of the hard ones (like S or Z).</p><p>This is the probability matrix:</p><p>const pieceProbabilities = {\n   1: [0.20, 0.18, 0.16, 0.14, 0.14, 0.09, 0.09], // Monday\n   2: [0.18, 0.17, 0.15, 0.14, 0.14, 0.11, 0.11], // Tuesday\n   3: [0.16, 0.15, 0.15, 0.14, 0.14, 0.13, 0.13], // Wednesday\n   4: [0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 0.15, 0.15], // Thursday\n   5: [0.12, 0.12, 0.12, 0.15, 0.15, 0.17, 0.17], // Friday\n   6: [0.10, 0.12, 0.12, 0.15, 0.15, 0.18, 0.18], // Saturday\n   7: [0.09, 0.10, 0.13, 0.15, 0.15, 0.19, 0.19]  // Sunday\n };</p><p>I hope this explains it well!</p></div>"
